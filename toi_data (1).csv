0,"Updated: Mar 6, 2019, 11:22 IST",Jyothi Prabhakar,Movies,Sivakarthikeyan reminds me of Rajini sir: Isha,"Eighteen years have been kind to her; those who saw Isha Koppikar that many years ago in En Swasa Kaatre, opposite Arvind Swami, will recognise her in a jiffy even now. Tell her that, and she sasses back, “Nothing has changed here either. Same people, same city, same attitude… everything’s the same even now.” And this sets the tone for a then-and-now chat with her. Prompt with her answers, candid, with a healthy dose of self-praise thrown in, Isha tells why she stopped acting in Tamil films, why she’s, for the lack of a better word, making a ‘comeback’ with Sivakarthikeyan’s movie with Ravi Kumar as a femme fatale, and what she’s been up to in all these years…
A film with Sivakarthikeyan, no less!
This project has been on for almost a year now. Last August, we had one schedule, then the January one this year got delayed and fell into February. We have one in September now.

So, a comeback?
I guess, yeah, you can call it that. Two years ago, I stepped into the south industry again with the Telugu movie Keshava, then did Looti in Kannada, I have another one lined up with Shivaraj sir… word got around and Ravi Kumar got in touch with me for this one, saying he has a role he wanted me to play. I played a cop in all of the movies mentioned above, but this one was full-on action, kind of Lara Croft-ish, and that got me interested.
A lot has changed in 18 years, has it?
Nothing has changed — I don’t know whether this is good or bad. But there still are no heroine-centric roles down south, no experimentation, the same kind of stories. New-age cinema seems to have flown right over Tamil cinema. In Bollywood, we now have films that are with the times, like Gully Boy, there are small-budget films that have done exceedingly well — that Vicky Donor wave that brought in Shubh Mangal Saavdhan, Bareilly Ki Barfi, Badhaai Ho… almost all of Ayushmann Khurrana’s films should have made people down south think about upgrading the art of movie making, but no… we’re in love with stereotypes.

The stars?
Oh, they too! They too! Arvind Swami is still around, Vijay is still at the top… when I focused back on south, I realised all my co-stars of 18 years ago are the one still rocking.

The going was good for you back then. Why did you leave?
I was studying. All of 15, just out of school, and I come from a family of doctors and educated people. So my dad said nothing doing. You must complete your graduation, or you are not stepping out of the house for anything. He said just in case your acting career doesn’t work out, you must have something to fall back upon. Well, that’s the system we live in, so I could hardly argue. So, I went on to complete BSc in Life Sciences. But between that, coming down south to do movies wasn’t possible. I kept modelling and doing music videos in Bombay, as I could juggle that because it was right there. The boarding, lodging, the distance meant I couldn’t juggle the schedules of Tamil films with that same ease. And when I turned 21, was done with studies and all, it was too late, I was well-settled in Mumbai.

Now, you are a mom. And the industry, especially down south, isn’t known to be fascinated with that ilk…
Yeah, I feel that; all the time. But not explicitly, not yet. I mean no one has said that to my face. Of course, Ramya Krishnan has done a great job with her career – she’s continued right through marriage and all. But when people here look at me, the first reaction is, ‘How have you maintained yourself so well?’ They’re surprised that I am still in shape despite marriage and childbirth. I tell them if you want to be in show business, you better look good!

They tell you you’re hot?
That’s the common refrain. ‘My God, you still look awesome.’ It makes me feel great. All the carbs I have not eaten all these years is at last making me feel it was all worth it. But I am amazed how I have been welcomed here — with grace and aplomb.

So, what are you doing in this Sivakarthikeyan movie?
It’s something not seen before here. We have not had the concept of a well-etched out ‘alien’ in Tamil cinema before this. Even in Bollywood, there was Jaadu in Koi... Mil Gaya, that’s it. And even that was more of prosthetics. But this film is all about CG. It’s almost as if two films are being made — one on computer and CG, and one that we are physically shooting.

Any old friends? Favourite stars?
I meet old, and new ones, too. Favourite stars… Arvind Swami is my all-time favourite because I have worked with him. And I used to be quite fond of Ajith back then — I don’t know if he’s still around, though…

And Sivakarthikeyan, your current co-star?
He reminds me so much of a younger version of Rajini sir that sometimes I am taken aback.

Why? Does he emulate Rajinikanth?
No, it’s not because of his mannerisms, or anything. I am not saying he’s consciously trying to emulate Rajini sir, but it’s there. Maybe the hair, the face, the look in the eye, the colour… Something.

There are so many Bollywood heroines trying to make a mark down south now. Will you find your niche?
But there is no action heroine down south, yet. And I fit the bill — I play the femme fatale in this one, and I look like that. Even if I say so myself, I know that I am versatile. People look at my role in Shabri and say, oh, de-glam. But truth is I was made to look de-glam with heavy makeup because I know that I look good without any makeup, too. I used to spend hours scrubbing off all that during Shabri. I also love these kind of dancing and action roles, too. I am a black belt in Taekwondo, and I still practise twice a week, fitness is a passion with me, and that helps.

And the language?
I am good with languages. I can grasp easily, plus, I used to chant Sanskrit mantras when I was young, and that helps with the pronunciation. I encourage all of them on the set to speak to me in Tamil.

So, when you have to emote in a strange language, or that chemistry with a co-star you’ve never heard of before, how does that happen?
The emoting isn’t tough — happiness and sadness have no language. About the co-star, yea, I still don’t know anything about Sivakarthikeyan personally. But thankfully, there’s no love between us in the movie. I am the killing machine and all full of hatred! I look glam, and hot and am the femme fatale. So thankfully, no love and chemistry.

Have you travelled much down south?
I’ve been to Tirupati, and the other day, on the way to the shooting spot, on OMR, I saw all these shoe stores so we zipped in there. I love food from Saravana Bhavan, and Krishna Sweets – I take their mysorepak for the whole city when I go back. (laughs)


What else — what have you been up to all these years?
I’m a full-time mother, now, have a hospitality business, production house, and am also into politics now, having joined the BJP.


Why politics?
I believe we need a strong leader, strict rules and laws. We Indians work only under pressure. If we are told ‘if you don’t do this, you’ll be penalised’, we will do it. We need to be forced into compliance, and hence need strict ruling. Look at all our scriptures, for instance. Most of what’s in them are scientific, but how did they make us follow them? By putting the fear of God in us — ‘If you don’t do this, something bad will happen’…


But there are so many stars out there as politicians…
I don’t care. I believe that because we are celebs, people tend to accept what we do or say sooner than they would an

aam aadmi. That’s why we endorse products. So why not endorse thoughts and ideologies? Why not help the helpless?"

City-based group Theatre Dots is opening a sequel to its well-received drama, Act or Not to Act, in the city this weekend. The new piece, titled Say No to Plays, is filled with scenes of laughter and a few awkward and serious moments. It scrutinises 15 reasons to make one think twice before auditioning for a play.

“Primarily divided in two parts, the play features as many as 30 young artistes, who are constantly in pressure to meet the expectations of their parents while pursuing their dream in performing arts. Obsession and addiction are among the themes that are explored in the course of the play. Six monologues comprise the first half of the performance, while the second half dabbles in questions like what is more important — the depth or prominence of an actor in a scene, or how much he/she has actually enjoyed enacting it,” explains Pooja Singh, writer and director of the play.


Loosely based on an American play series, Say No to Plays “offers a glimpse into teenagers’ private thoughts”. The story aims at making one introspect about the amount of pressure that is mounted on kids. The 80-minute show also includes an original track, the lyrics of which are written by Pooja, and music is composed by two students. It is being staged at Rangasthala auditorium, Rangoli Metro Art Center on March 3."

The film, directed by V Harikrishna and P Kumar, pairs Darshan with Rashmika Mandanna and has actors like Tanya Hope, Devaraj, Dhananjaya, P Ravi Shankar and Thakur Anoop Singh, as part of its ensemble cast. Here, Darshan tells us what makes his film a must-watch.

“For starters, I want to clarify that we have not set out to do anything extraordinary. Yajamana is a clean entertainer with the right amounts of action, comedy, romance and drama that will appeal to family audiences. Apart from the fact that it is my film, Yajamana has a strong story and message for society. Cinematographer Sreesha Kuduvalli’s visuals are a highlight and the two tones he has used in different parts of the film are noteworthy. The songs by Harikrishna are an added bonus. Most importantly, you will see a variation in my dialogue delivery,” says Darshan."

There are so many things you can do with them apart from the regular. Here are four genius hacks that will leave you impressed.
Smelly shoe deodorizer

Spread the paper towel on the table and add 3-4 tablespoons of baking soda. Now roll the paper and seal using a rubberband. The next time your shoes smell, prepare such potlis and slide it inside your shoes to free them of the smell.


Empower your wiper
Do you have wooden flooring at home and can't use wet mops? Well, there is an easy hack for that - for which you can use paper towels. Slide and tear a big paper towel and attach it to the bottom of your regular wiper - lock it well to the corner too so it doesn't move. Now spray slight water on it or any disinfectant. Mop the floor and you will see how it magically attracts all the mess, keeping your wooden floor clean and clear.


Use the roll to save plastic bags

What do you do when the paper towel roll gets empty - throw it? Well, do not. The plastic bags that you keep stocking here and there can all be stored inside these rolls without creating any clutter.


Turn it into a cord organiser

Another brilliant use of the empty roll is to use them as cord organiser. Cut them into two and slide your wires/cord inside to keep them safe and detangled.


Aren't paper towels more versatile than you think? Dust, declutter and deodorize!"
4,"Created: Mar 1, 2019, 00:00 IST",Priyanka Dasgupta,Movies,Maneka Gandhi and NCW take cognizance of #MeToo cases,"On Wednesday afternoon, singer Chinmayi Sripada tweeted to Union Minister for Women and Child Development Maneka Gandhi and National Commission for Women (NCW), highlighting that no action has been taken after she named Vairamuthu as her predator in the #MeToo movement. She wrote, “Maam, it’s been 4 months since I named Mr Vairamuthu as my predator. I have since then been banned from work in the TN Film Industry (Dubbing Union). The law as of today doesn’t allow me to file a case. Please give me a solution. @PMOIndia (Sic).” Soon after, Maneka Gandhi replied to her, “I have taken up your case with@NCWIndia. Kindly DM your contact details.” Talking to us, the singer says, “I’m grateful that she responded this time. I’m waiting to see if this will lead to something. The NCW has been given complaints before. They just need to take cognizance of complaints and set up an enquiry commission. They could have easily set up a fact-finding committee and called us and the offenders for an enquiry. We don’t know whose door to knock on. So many playback singers have anonymously taken names of their offenders, but since there’s no action, they are not willing to speak up. Solli enna aaga poradhu? Unakku edhavadhu aacha? (What will happen with sharing our story? Did anything happen from your case?) — that’s what they ask. I hope there is a positive outcome now at least.”

Sruthi hopeful with this move

Meanwhile, Kannada actress Sruthi Hariharan, who had come forth with her #MeToo ordeal against actor-filmmaker Arjun Sarja sees this as a significant step. “Chinmayi has been relentless in her pursuit for the #MeTooIndia movement. She has not only stood her ground and fought her case, but has helped many others share their case. I am glad that she tagged Maneka Gandhi and the Prime Minister’s office in her tweet, because she finally got a reply. There are many cases that have gone to the NCW, so this is a start and I am hoping something comes out of it and people realise that this is something that needs to be taken seriously,” she says.

Sruthi adds, “What is commendable is that Maneka Gandhi has asked political parties to set up Internal Complaints Committees. Every organisation needs one, in every sector. These committees are means by which women can express their voice and concern.”

Unlike Chinmayi, who hadn’t got support from the Tamil Nadu State Women’s Commission, Sruthi did in Karnataka, she says. “The women’s commission had filed a suo moto case, as well as one in the cyber crime cell based on the obscene messages that I received on phone and on social media,” explains Sruthi, who adds that she is currently waiting for the next hearing of the case she has filed against Arjun in a court of law."

6,"Created: Mar 1, 2019, 00:00 IST",Ruman Ganguly,Movies,How much courage does it take to credit a source?,"Does it take away anything from a director’s accolades if he acknowledges a source? Does the stature of a director dip if he shares the writing credits? Does it cost a lot to pay a few lakhs to procure rights of Bengali novels/short stories?The answer is a big No.
That’s something Anurag Kashyap understood when he directed Dev.D. He went to town to acknowledge that he was making a modern-day adapatation of Saratchandra Chattopadhyay novel. No one would have dragged him to court had he not mentioned that. Yet, Anurag spoke about his Saratchandra connection. In our own backyard, Buddhadab Dasgupta directed Dooratwa from Sirshendu Mukherjee’s work. His Tahader Katha was based on Kamal Kumar Majumdar’s story by the same name. While his Uttara was adapted from Samaresh Basu’s work, Charachar was an adaptation of a Prafulla Roy work. More recently, when Aparna Sen directed Arshinagar with Dev as Ranajit Mitra and Rittika Sen as Julekha Khan, she mentioned it was a musical adaptation of William Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet.

Unfortunately, there are many who find it too difficult to credit a source. That’s why plagiarism charges have been levelled by fans and family members of authors like Moti Nandi, Atin Bandopadhyay and Suchitra Bhattacharya, among others. In some cases, the similarities are coincidental. In others, there is a lot more than that.
The problem is the culture of silence. Most authors don’t protest for fear of problems. But, they crib in privacy while expecting the world around to fight for their rights. Directors, meanwhile, happily ruin the chances of official adaptation rights being sold to those willing to credit.
LEGENDS ARE USUALLY SPARED
Works of Rabindranath Tagore, Satyajit Ray, Saratchandra Chattopadhyay, Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay, Saradindu Bandopadhyay, Bibhutibushan Bandopadhyay or Tarashankar Bandopadhyay have largely been credited. When Manas read the three-page Bibhutibushan story titled Taal Nabami, he added some characters and finally, made the 90-minute-long Sahaj Paather Gappo. “It is all about an individual’s ethics. To each his own. For me, giving credit — however little I take from a novel or story — is my duty and responsibility,” says Manas.

IS IT AN EGO ISSUE?

Perhaps, ego plays an important role. “Even Sunil Gangopadhyay was not spared. An internationally-reputed director had lifted some portions from his Shei Samay while making a movie. Not just films, Bengali serials too have cases where the original writers weren’t credited. A few years back, Atin Bandopadhyay’s Neel Kantha Pakhir Khonje was telecast as a popular serial without acknowledging him. Such controversies were unheard of with directors like Ray, Ghatak or Mrinal Sen. Today’s Tollywood directors try to place themselves in a position which does not rightfully belong to them. They also ignore the financial aspect,” says author Prabal Kumar Basu.


TOLLYWOOD’S FIRST-BOY SYNDROME

Some directors also end up measuring the extent of the inspiration. But that’s not the point, insists Buddhadeb. “I adapted Mondo Meyer Upakhyan from Prafulla Roy’s short story by the same name. I made Grihajuddha from Dibyendu Palit’s Maach. I made Tope from Narayan Gangopdhyay’s work. In all these cases, I changed a lot from the original works. Trust me, it takes away nothing from a director’s skill if the writing credit goes to someone else. Nobody thought of me as any less of a director for adapting Maach,” says Buddhadeb. This “first-boy syndrome”, he says, is doing harm to the industry. “It’s not that great movies are being made when sources remain undisclosed,” adds Buddhadeb.


DOES EVERYONE WANT TO BE A NEW-AGE RAY?

Just as a bohemian attitude can’t turn a director into Ritwik Ghatak, being a writer-director too can’t thrust the genius of Ray on makers. Many don’t realise that Bengal still has a fair share of bookworms who can easily identify sources. Some years ago, authors like Sirshendu Mukherjee and Debesh Roy had written to Bangladesh’s information ministry to protest when plagiarism charges were levelled on the makers of Brihannala in Bangladesh for copying Syed Mustafa Siraj’s Gachta Bolecilo. Subsequently, the Bangladesh government cancelled three national film awards bestowed upon Brihannala. Abhijit Siraj, the author’s son, says, “This wouldn’t have happened without a protest. Silence is a crime. Such plagiarism will continue if an author doesn’t have a spine to stand up for his rights.”


Well, is everyone listening?"
7,"Created: Mar 1, 2019, 00:00 IST",Zinia Sen,Movies,‘I had a Malayalam connection right from my Telugu debut’,"The shoot of veteran director Kamal’s next film Pranaya Meenukalude Kadal is on in Lakshadweep and its lead actress Riddhi Kumar is having a gala time on the set, picking up new skills, conversing in Malayalam and more.

The Maharashtra-born actress, who debuted last year in Telugu through the film Lover with Raj Tarun, is, however, no alien to Malayalam.


“I played a Malayali nurse in my Telugu debut and still remember lines like Enikku Ee Kalyanam Venda,” Riddhi says, with no hint of difficulty. She adds, “And that was a short line. There were longer lines I had to say, but actress Rohini maam, who was also part of the film, helped me out immensely. I remember a few other words too, like manasilaayi,” says the actress who has done two films in Telugu.

Riddhi isn't allowed to speak much about her character, but she discloses she had to be “friendly” with the waters a lot more than she was, till then. “I learnt to swim in the pool but doing the same in sea water was a lot more challenging. It remained scary for a long time but I guess after that first push, I gradually learnt to tame it,” says the actress, who is happy she is getting a lot of help from her crew to learn Malayalam, as well.

“My favourite Malayalam word is poocha!” says Ridhi, who apparently befriended a black-coloured kitten who kept hanging around her room and sets during the shoot. “I named her poocha and as I am a vegetarian, I also feed her whatever fish we get with our tiffin,” she says with a chuckle."
8,"Created: Mar 1, 2019, 00:00 IST",Sunayana Suresh,Movies,Mahalaya will go down in the history of Bengali cinema for its subject: Jisshu,"He’s playing Uttam Kumar in Soumik Sen’s debut Bengali film, Mahalaya. In a chat with us, Jisshu U Sengupta talks about his experience of playing the legend, childhood memories of Mahalaya, working with the new director and the film. Excerpts:
What was your first reaction when Soumik approached you to play Uttam Kumar?

When I heard the script, I was blown away, as I was not aware of the 1976 incident when Uttam Kumar had replaced Birendra Krishna Bhadra’s voice in Mahishasura Mardini. Initially, I was jittery at the thought of playing the legend. But I later realised the film is much more than that.


How challenging was it to step into the shoes of the legend?
I’ve played the character in my own way and I request everyone to not compare me with the stalwart. My mother-in-law told me how Uttam Kumar was as a person. She said Uttam babu was witty, big-hearted, a foodie and always eager to help the technicians. These details helped me portray him better. Not for once did I try to copy him.

Tell us about the film.

The film explores the psyche behind the government’s decision to replace Birendra Krishna Bhadra and tries to answer some popular queries — did Uttam Kumar do it willingly and what was Birendra Krishna Bhadra’s reaction? Did they actually have a fight over this?


How was it working with Soumik?

He is a very sorted director, completely chilled out on the sets. He knows exactly what he wants from his team. It needs courage to make a film like this, so kudos to Bumbada (Prosenjit Chatterjee) for taking the initiative. Not for once did he interfere with the script or anything related to the film. I don’t know how much money the film will make at the box office but it will surely go down in the history of Bengali cinema for its subject. Subhasish Mukhopadhyay’s performance as Birendra Krishna Bhadra is just brilliant.


Do you listen to Mahishasura Mardini on Mahalaya?

Oh yes! During my childhood, Ma would wake me up early morning and I’d invariably fall asleep after listening to it for half an hour or so. Mahalaya meant no studies, so that used to be fun."
9,"Updated: Mar 1, 2019, 12:28 IST",Divya Kaushik,Movies,I’m grateful that Swapnamoy has revised his view: Kaushik Ganguly,"A day after social media turned into a warzone what with allegations of plagiarism levelled against Kaushik Ganguly’s Nagarkirtan, it has gone all quiet on the virtual front. Author Swapnamoy Chakraborty, who also spoke to CT after many pointed out the similarities between the novel, Holde Golap and the film, made a U-turn after watching it on Wednesday. “It’s not a cinematic adaptation of my film,” he said.


Said the author, “I was wary as I had heard about Abul Bashar’s incident, where he felt that his Naram Hridoyer Chinho was plagiarised in Shunyo E Buke. Also, many said Khaad bore resemblances with a film. That’s why I had given the post.” Chakraborty attributed the similarities with a few common sources. “I spoke to several people and also did field survey while penning the story; chances are, Kaushik Ganguly spoke to the same people. If Kaushik today says he hasn’t read my book, I won’t be able to say he’s lying,” said the author.


Chakraborty, who says the credits appeared on the screen for a fleeting two seconds, said it could have lingered on for a bit more time. “While writing my novel, I spoke to Manabi Bandopadhyay, among others. She gave me valuable inputs. Looks like, she has provided a lot of matter to Kaushik too. But at the end of it, it’s a love story that mine is not. Having said that, I will never disrespect the views of those who pointed out the similarities.” Said Kaushik, “What he had said was out of his concerns about his novel. Though it’s sad that he couldn’t keep faith in me, I am grateful that he finally watched the film and revised his statement. But I’m far more worried about those who aren’t Swapnamoy Chakraborty and made one post after another on social media. During mob violence, the target is sometimes tied to the lamppost and even passers-by, without knowing what is happening, pelt stones at him. Social media has become a violent place. The ones writing against me are those for whom I make films. And every story of mine can be similar to another story happening in some part of the world. I write stories out of my own experiences and another person may be going through the same at some point in time. All I want to say is, think before you act. For tomorrow, you may have to regret for what you are

doing today.”"

The actress, who is now looking forward to the release of her next, Sujoy Ghosh’s thriller 'Badla', with Amitabh Bachchan, says, “A lot of things happened between 'Pink' and 'Badla' that validated my choices and made me a more confident actor. When 'Pink' happened, I did not know which way my career was going to go. I was trying and testing different films to see where my calling was and when 'Pink' released, it gave me a direction. After that, I was sure of one thing – that I would always take up roles which are part of the main storyline. I mean, if you take out this character from the film, the story will not be the same. The other thing is that I want to play a woman with a spine, because I can connect personally to it and that helps me perform better. The audience response to my work has sort of validated my choice of films.” Taapsee, who was in her hometown Delhi recently, adds that like her previous roles, in 'Badla', she is again playing a strong woman who stands her ground and is confident. She adds, “The character I am playing is pretty confident from the beginning itself. You will not see her vulnerable side, and you won’t see her as someone who would think she is helpless. She knows very well what she wants, she is borderline arrogant because she has made everything for herself from scratch in a foreign land. She has this thing in her mind that no matter what, I will manoeuvre my way out of any situation. She has appointed this lawyer, played by Mr Bachchan in the film. She has hired this man to fight her case, and she has that control over the person she has employed. Like Sujoy’s female characters in his other films like 'Kahaani', this one too is extremely powerful.”




Though Taapsee agrees that there are few examples of good, edge-of-the-seat thrillers in Bollywood, she feels that 'Badla' won’t disappoint. “One can’t think of many good thrillers in Bollywood. 'Kahaani' was a good thriller, so was 'Gupt'. Thriller is one of the oldest genres of cinema, but these days, people are not touching it much. The reason could be that it is a very tricky genre, at any point, if your audience can predict the end, your film has fallen flat. You have to keep the audience so engrossed that they are not able to predict the end. Even if you leave theatre for 30 seconds while watching 'Badla', you won’t understand what has happened, you won’t be able to connect the dots,” says Taapsee, who will be sharing screen space with Bachchan again in 'Badla' after 'Pink'. “My confidence level was surely different this time when I worked with him. After 'Pink', I share a certain comfort level in working with him, but even in 'Pink' working with him was never intimidating for me. I am not a very star-struck person, may be because of the fact that I didn’t grow up obsessing over films. I had seen Mr Bachchan’s films while having lunch or dinner with family, but it’s not like I have grown in awe of all the actors. I only get intimidated when I am with a bunch of extremely talented actors, where I know I am not a trained actor, which happened in 'Mulk' with me. But I enjoy working with Mr Bachchan. People think I must be blanking out when I look into his eyes and perform, but I actually get excited,” she says.

For, this hue can be seen in so many variations — baby pink, light millennial pink, coral, soft shell enamel, fuchsia, and more. And at the recent Oscar Awards it was another shade of the colour that stood out as the most popular fashion trend for the night — bright pink! There was almost a sea of gowns in the hue — in poufy frills, netted ruffles, princess-style trail gowns, bubble-gum hued tulles and more. It’s being described by fashion analysts as ‘joyful’ and ‘what modern couture should be like’. As it upped the sartorial ante, it got fashion pundits asking: Is pink the new black?
Hollywood royalty gives it the nod


(L-R) Actress Angela Bassett’s wore a vivid fuchsia gown with a massive bow and pretty clutch and actress Helen Mirren looked equally stunning in her A-line dress with contrasting pink hues


(L-R) Actress Sarah Paulson’s princess-like gown had edgy, side cut-outs and actress Linda Cartellini wowed in a poofy, bubblegum-hued gown

The attention-grabbing pink dresses were seen on a bunch of stars. ‘Crazy Rich Asians’ star Gemma Chan wore a voluminous gown in magenta. She also snuck a cookie into her pockets to probably munch on during the whole event. While Linda Cardellini seemed to pile on pink stylishly, Kacey Musgraves stole it with her cotton-candy-pink tulle net ensemble and Sarah Paulson opted for a billowy, cutout-style fuchsia gown. But it was veteran actress Angela Bassett who was the reigning queen of the night as most sites called her. She turned heads in her exaggerated hot pink shoulder gown with its thigh-high slit and a gem-shaped clutch. Also in close running for wearing the hue stylishly were actresses Helen Mirren and Julia Roberts. Mirren swished in with her frothy pink tulle and Roberts dished up Oscars chic in her flowy-but-fitted one-shouldered bright pink dress with an asymmetrical leg slit. And guess what? Pink wasn’t for the women alone. Aquaman Jason Momoa’s pink tuxedo, complete with a scrunchie, much to fans’ delight!

Yes, men are wearing it, too



Who says pink is just for the ladies? Men can look just as hot in the hue. Jason Momoa wore a pink velvet tux with a matching scrunchie to the awards and 'Black Panther' actor Chadwick Boseman also chose the hue for the Oscars after party.


How to wear the hue in your day




While shocking pink and its cousins heated up the red carpet at the Oscars, you can just as easily wear the hue in your daily life. Here are tips to do so:

- Pink is the colour for any season — it adds vibrancy to winter and lends a lovely hue to summer. So, go with skater, shift dresses and other styles in it, for the upcoming season.
- Yes, this is a pretty shade, but you don’t want to look too girly in it, so break the monotony of the hue with black, navy blue and grey.
- Since pink is also a light shade, it is perfect for those ruffles, frills and poufs.
- Keep away the stiff, black heels and make pink your new neutral footwear. Opt for pumps, peep toes, kitten heels and stilettos in bright or baby pink.

- Planning to wear all-black? Pink comes in as the perfect complement. Wear pink stud earrings or hoops as well a pop pink clutch or quilted bag to go with the rest of the look.

- Love athleisure? Weave pink into your gym wear with pink keds, tracks with a neon pink stripe or even a fuchsia top over those black leggings.

- Team a pink halter with white jeans for a day outdoors.

- Grab a pair of sunnies with a pink frame to complete the look. Dab on the eyeshadow to match."

The wedding was followed by a reception. The celebrations began two days before the wedding with a sangeet ceremony, which had performances by the bride and groom and their families. Since all the naach-gaana had happened on the sangeet, the wedding and the reception were formal affairs. musical bonding: It was their common interest in music that brought Bhavana and Dennis together.

21,Sunayana Suresh,TNN,Movies,Helping autistic individuals thrive through the arts,"It usually happens that after reaching the age of 18-20 years, an autistic individual no more receives the kind of educational support that is offered at a younger age. Apart from certain specific training programmes, the individual is often excluded from other help. While education remains a life-long process for everyone else, a large number of autistic individuals are deprived of it at an early age,” says artist and art consultant Sneha Joshi, who is curating Eye Contact: An insight into autism — a special event in Bengaluru.

While the primary goal of the initiative is to raise awareness about the developmental disorder, help erase the stigma around it and make art more accessible to autistic individuals, the event —which comprises an exhibition, a performance and a panel discussion — also aims at forming a more inclusive society that embraces marginalised communities and help them thrive. “We want to take conversations about autism to public places and open forums, where people can participate and discuss issues and possible solutions. This would not only enable young adults suffering from this disorder express themselves, but also create a comfort zone for them to identify their inherent talents and showcase them,” explains Sneha, who has an autistic brother. Family narratives as well as personal experiences of caretakers are other focus areas of the initiative. According to Sneha, art and media can be instrumental in making society more inclusive. The event will be conducted by Colours Centre for Learning, in association with The Be A Smile Project — a research project investigating autism and society. It’s taking place from April 5-7 at Rangoli – Metro Art Centre.


The showcase will include paintings, video work, pictures, as well as interactive activities for visitors. The artists participating in the exhibition include Dattaprasad Sawardekar, Kajal Ashar, Sachin Joshi and Tanisha Lahiri. The funds collected through the initiative will be used for the remuneration of the artists and for the development of an arts training centre for the autistic individuals. The movement arts performance — which is an adaptation of Mark Haddon’s The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time — is crafted by contemporary dancer-choreographer Priyabrat Panigrahi.

In fact, the original makers of the song, which includes musicians The Doorbeen and singer Ragini, have expressed their pleasure on listening to the cover. “I have a friend, who goes by the name Bren Garage on social media, who is an automobile enthusiast and has some exclusive limited edition super cars.

Aneesh is already set for his next collaboration. “When I was on the Kannada television show Majaa Talkies, I played a version of Nana Mele Nanageega from Krishi Thapanda’s film Kannadakkaagi Ondannu Otti, which she loved.

24,Tanvi PS,TNN,Movies,"Vellai Pookal is a unique film, says Vivekh","Many ‘new’ comedians have made a mark for themselves in Kollywood of late and are doing back-to-back films. But Vivekh’s comedy, which often touches upon social causes, still remains the favourite of many Kollywood film buffs. The veteran actor, who still gives young comedians a run for their money, thanks to his spontaneity and thought-provoking one-liners, is gung-ho about his upcoming projects, among which he considers Vellai Pookal to be unique. In a freewheeling chat withus, he talks about topics that include movies, nature conservation, sexual crimes, caste system, and more...
Looks like Vellai Pookal isn’t ‘your kind of film’. You are playing a serious cop and have sported salt ‘n’ pepper looks, too…
It all started when the film’s director Vivek Elangovan, a US-based Microsoft engineer, approached me with a story. But I was skeptical about the project even materialising when the makers said they wanted me to go to the US. They needed my dates for a month and asked me to go to Seattle. Later, they sent me the summary of the film, but I said I need the entire script, which has details of every scene irrespective of the number of scenes I’m a part of. After going through it, I felt this is a script which someone who has Sathyaraj sir’s physique and screen presence would do justice to. But they convinced me by saying that audience will be prepared to watch certain scenes with actors who have not done such roles before. I play a retired DIG (Intelligence) who goes to the US to meet his son, with whom he has had a difference of opinion. Audience expect comedy from me, so I had reservations initially. But then, I felt this is the right time to try something different. Our viewers are yearning for novelty these days and they appreciate honest and innovative attempts.

How has the industry reacted to your makeover?
Many of them loved it. AR Rahman has always been a good friend of mine. I showed him the teaser and he was impressed by it. I asked him if he could do music and he said he has his hands full. We told him that we can wait till he gets sometime from his hectic schedule. Though we waited for a year, he couldn’t do it because of his busy assignments.
There is an influx of thrillers in Kollywood now. How is this film going to be different?
The good thing is all these films were received well, which is an advantage for our project, too. Our film has lot of mind games and edge-of-the-seat moments with ample emotions. Though most artistes in it are from the US, Charlie, Pooja Devariya and newbie Dev have interesting roles in it.

What are your other projects?
These days, many seem to be embracing agriculture. I have been thinking about a movie on farming and related stuff and am currently writing a script — it needs a commercially viable hero. I will be directing the movie, too, which will have humour as its main attraction, though the content discussed in it will be quite serious and relevant.

You are teaming up with Vijay after a long time in Atlee’s upcoming film.
We are teaming up after more than a decade. Kuruvi was the last film we did together. He had called me up recently and said that he’s happy to join hands with me again. Vijay told me “we should rock” and Atlee is keen on portraying me in a jovial role. I’m excited to join the team soon.

There was news on you teaming up with Sivakarthikeyan
That was actually news for me as well. Siva had once said that I’m his inspiration for doing comedy. I would love to do a movie with him.

You had a small role in Viswasam which went on to become one of the top grossing films in the state
I’m so happy the movie did well. Siva approached me and said that my role comes only in the second half. He said there are scenes where I have to make fun of Ajith’s character and that I would be the best person for the same. We had some beautifully shot scenes, but couldn’t retain it. There is a scene where I utter his popular dialogue “en vazhkaila ovvoru naalum ovvoru nimishamum yen ovvoru nodiyaiyum naana sedhukkunadhu da” to him, to which he gives a funny counter. Fans would have loved that scene has it been retained. It was a pleasure to work again with Nayanthara after a decade, as well.

Are there any recent movies from which you enjoyed comedy thoroughly?
There are many and it would be difficult to choose a few among them. The style of comedy in cinema has now changed. The average duration of a movie was more than 2.30 hours when Vadivelu and I used to have separate comedy tracks. Now people are impatient and can’t sit through a movie which is more than two hours. Even when watching movies of lesser duration, they get sidetracked with mobile videos and messages on phone. So, we comedians do not get so much of time to create an impact. People who perform in Tik Tok and YouTube channels have more followers these days because they have the liberty to take as much as time they want to. It’s difficult to perform full-fledged comedy like how I did in films like Saamy, Kadhal Sadugudu, Uthamaputhiran, Maapillai, Padikkathavan, etc.

Is there a movie after watching which you felt disappointed not being a part of it?
I was in talks with the veteran filmmaker KC Bokadia for a political film which had good dose of humour. That was around the time LKG and NOTA were announced, and went on floors. And so Bokadia’s film was scrapped. But after watching LKG, I felt we should have gone ahead with our movie as well. Our project would also have been liked by audience.


Looks like we are heading towards a scorching summer this year. As a nature enthusiast, do you think we are taking our natural resources for granted?
I have now completed planting 30.23 lakh saplings and have 70 lakh more to complete the mission given by the beloved Abdul Kalam sir. I have always been vocal about preserving water and living a nature-friendly life. Many homes here haven’t received metro water for a long time. People are slowly realising that depending on AC while staying indoors will not work. In places like Pudukottai and other delta areas, you get bore water only after digging 2,000 ft deep. Of late, many people talk about the need to provide water to birds. The unfortunate fact is that human beings are also running short of water. At least five trees should be planted for every tree which is cut down.


To what extent do you think the #MeToo movement has created an impact in the film industry here?
I think awareness has been created now. Our culture has always been about treating women as mothers. It is sad that women are treated as mere sex objects by many. Even small children are being sexually abused. Sexual perversion, frustration and depression are turning people into beasts. Only stringent punishment can control such incidents. When an accused gets bail easily and such cases take years to get a verdict, people aren’t really worried about the law. The easy access to pornography is another reason why, I think, there is an increase in the number of such crimes. We never had so many shocking crimes two or three decades ago. In such cases, 25 per cent is due to the influence of cinema and 75 per cent because of unlimited access to pornography.


As a socially-conscious person what do you think are things which require urgent attention?
We need self-sufficient farmers, massive planting of trees, innovative ways to conserve water and proper education. Education is the key to abolishing caste system. There was a time I felt such discrimination is coming to an end, but sadly, it has only come up all over again in the recent times. Even in today’s age of WhatsApp, Facebook, latest gadgets and communication facilities, people are discussing caste and using these apps to instigate communal riots."
25,Tanvi PS,TNN,Bollywood,Meet the men behind your favourite television soaps,"They have been bringing to life the characters that keep you glued to the television sets. They have been making sure the same characters seem believable and that they have contributed in heaps towards the serials’ popularity. And yet, they work behind the camera, away from the glitz and glamour. CT features the directors behind popular serials to know about their work, ambition and what makes them click with the audiences. Read on...


Rajendra Prasad Das
Known for: Karunamoyee Rani Rashmoni

Other significant works: I am working in the industry for the past 19-20 years and it’s been 8-9 years since I’ve stepped into a director’s shoes. I have directed serials like Milan Tithi, Mem Bou, Anchol, Tumi Robe Nirobe, Khona, Bindi to name a few. But Karunamoyee Rani Rashmoni is one serial that touched the pinnacle of popularity.


What makes his serial/serials stand out: Rani Rashmoni is a popular character but people did not know much about her. The serial is not a documentary on her neither it is a historical piece. I try to tell a story through the serial and I hope that I’ve been able to keep it interesting. I love to experiment with characters, moments and storyline and I guess that has worked for the better.

Big screen aims: If I get the opportunity, I will surely want to direct a film. I believe in the adage, cross the bridge when you get there.

‘I am working with Rajen uncle since two years and he is nothing less than a father to me. From guiding me to making me learn all the nitty-gritty of acting — he has taught me a lot. He sometimes shouts at us but I know it’s to make sure we give our best. What I like the most about him is his approach towards a scene. He gives a lot of space to his actors and always asks them to act logically. The credit for the serial’s popularity goes entirely to him. His constant suggestion to us is that we shouldn’t let success go to our heads’
— Ditipriya Roy (who plays the titular character)

Babu Banik
Known for: Jahaanara

Other significant works: Jahaanara is my 19th serial. Previously I have worked on Niyoti, Bodhu Boron, Amar Durga, Jamai Raja to name a few. My first direction was for Raat Bhor Bhristi followed by Ei Ghor Ei Songsar, Heroes and Lukhochuri. Three to four of my serials have crossed more than 1,000 episodes. I believe that’s no mean feat!
What makes his serial/serials stand out: I deal with bold subjects like triple talaq in Jahaanara. There’s no show on Bengali television that has touched upon this topic. The serial revolves around a Muslim girl, Jahaanara, who speaks for the rights of women. The serial is about women emancipation — told through the story of a Muslim girl — and that I believe is its uniqueness.



Big screen aims: I got a lot of offers to do remakes but I have maintained a strict no-no. I want to direct original films. I am currently working on two scripts. One is about a father-daughter relationship. Actor Arindam Ganguly and Kheyali Dastidar, who are my mentors, have arranged a meeting with Prosenjit Chatterjee because I wrote the script keeping Bumbada in mind. That apart, there is another script for which we are trying to get Nawazuddin Siddiqui on board. The story is about a guy who loses his wife due to gambling!

‘Jahaanara is my debut serial. Babuda is a very senior director but not for once has he made me feel like a newcomer. He explains a scene so well that there is hardly any room for confusion. And during late-night shoots, when we are all low on energy, he will shout, ‘mood chai team, mood ano’ and we immediately get all charged up!’
— Sweta Mishra (who plays the titular character)

Babu Banik
Known for: Jahaanara

Other significant works: I started my career as an assistant director in films like Bindaas, Majnu, Byomkesh Bakshi and Tor Naam. Later, I worked as an episode director for serials like Deep Jwele Jai and Soubhaggobati. I have debuted as a full-time director with Joyee.



What makes his serial/serials stand out: The story revolves around Joyee, who plays football and at the same time, looks after her household. She balances both the world and represents women in today’s time who strike a balance between thriving careers and happy homes. It encourages today’s youth to straddle both the worlds with ease. I try to lend a cinematic touch to the serial and I guess that makes it look different from the others.

Big screen aims: My ambition is to direct a thriller. I would love to cast Ritwick Chakraborty and Rudranil Ghosh in my debut film; that is if they are convinced with the story.

‘Arghyada’s dedication shows when he is behind the camera. He is like a guardian to
the unit. He is a great team leader’
— Debadrita Basu
(who plays the titular character)


Amit Sengupta
Known for: Debi Chaudhurani

Other significant works: I have directed more than 18-20 serials so far, including Khona, Kajori, Gouridaan, Subho Bibaho, Sedin Dujone, Kajallata and Meera.



What makes his serial/serials stand out: The life story of Debi Chaudhurani itself is the serial’s USP. The peroid drama, led by a woman protagonist, is set in a time when most women did not even show her face to men outside her immediate family. The show brings alive the story of Prafulla, an ordinary girl and her inspiring journey to become Debi Chaudhurani, a leader and warrior loved and respected by everyone.

Big screen aims: I’m working towards my goal of directing a film and I’m certain it will happen at the right time. There are a few stories in my mind.

‘This is my debut serial and I feel honoured to work with Amitda. From dialogue delivery to how to face the light — I have learned a lot from him. I wouldn’t be able to deliver difficult scenes if it wasn’t for Amitda’
— Sona Moni Saha (who plays the titular character)


Kamalesh Biswas
Known for: Ke Apon Ke Por

Other significant works: I have worked as episode director in more than 25 mega serials like Protidaan, Jibon Jyoti, Agnijol, Tomay Amay Mile, Kotha Dilam and Bamakhepa. Ke Apon Ke Por is my debut serial as a director.

What makes his serial/serials stand out: Ke Apon Ke Por is a huge hit among the audience because of its storyline. The story revolves around Jaba, who starts out as a domestic help and goes on to establish herself as someone who’s well suited to be the daughter-in-law of the household and a lawyer by profession. The story stresses on the fact that everything is possible if one has the determination and perseverance.

Big screen aims: I have worked as an assistant director in films like Glamour and Risk. But I’d love to direct a film someday. I’m already working on a story about a town where people are trying to bring in changes for the betterment of the public but are facing opposition from the government. I would love to cast Sohini Sarkar and Anirban Bhattacharya in this film.

‘This is the first time that I’m working with Kamaleshda and I’m thankful to him for teaching me the nuances of acting. The best part about him is that he never loses his cool on the sets and guides each and every actor so they can perform
better. He does his homework well so there is a method to his direction’
— Pallabi Sharma (who plays Jaba in the serial)


Subho (Subhashis Mondal)

Popular for: Mahaprabhu Sree Chaitanya

Other significant works: I started my career as an assistant director and got a lot of appreciation for my work in serials like Agnipariksha and Rashi. Radha, for which I was an episode director, got me a lot of praise because the audiences thought the serial was nothing less than a film look-wise. Mahaprabhu Sree Chaitanya is the first serial that I am directing and I am grateful that the audience has shown so much love for it.


What makes his work stand out: In today’s world of violence and hatred, the serial Mahaprabhu Sree Chaitanya tries to establish the fact that love and compassion still exist. Not only do I work on subjects that are relatable but I also try to shoot in a way that the serial looks realistic.


Big-screen plans: My dream is to direct a film someday. I’m already working on a few scripts that delve into topics like homosexuality and prostitution. I’m also planning to direct a love story where I want to cast Gaurav Chakrabarty and Ridhima Ghosh. For my debut film, I’d love to cast Abir Chatterjee and Parambrata Chatterjee."
26,Dhwani Desai,TNN,Theatre,Amala Paul to play a forensic pathologist,"We had told you that Amala Paul will be playing a forensic pathologist in an upcoming film titled Cadaver. The film, directed by debutant Anoop Panicker, went on floors on Monday, and the actress says that she needed to do a lot of prep work to get ready to play this role. “We have seen this character in investigative films, but here, the entire script revolves around one. Playing a forensic pathologist requires maturity and knowledge about the subject,” begins the actress.

Having taken computer science group in school and not being interested in the field of medicine then, Amala says that she needs a lot of support to play this role. “The script is by Abhilash Pillai, and he has taken inspiration from the book Oru Police Surgeonate Ormakurippukal by Dr Umadathan, a famous forensic surgeon in Kerala. I got a lot of insights into the character by reading the book. I also met Dr Umadathan and spoke to him about his work,” she informs.


Amala, who will not have any romantic pair in the film, also travelled with a forensic surgeon for a couple of days, both while he was at work and outside of it, to get to know more about their work and life. “I kept asking him a lot of questions on the nature of his work. I was trying to glean as much inspiration from him as possible. I don’t think I have had to do this much prep work, especially in terms of reading, for any of my roles so far,” she states.

Interestingly, the film will also see her turning producer for the first time. “The script demanded a certain kind of budget as it has to be shot on a lot of sets and locations. It is also somewhat dark and intense, and I felt that creative freedom was important if we were to make it that way. These are the kind of subjects that I firmly believe in, and if I don’t support the kind of films that I believe in, then, who will?” she asks.


The cast includes Athulya, Harish Uthaman and Ramesh Khanna among others. Music director Jakes Bejoy (of Dhuruvangal Pathinaaru fame), Demonte Colony cinematographer Aravind Singh, San Lokesh, who edited Ratsasan, are part of the crew."

The play was written and performed by Anuja Ghosalkar, a Bangalore-based artist, in three different languages Hindi, English and Marathi. Even though not many in the audience understood the Marathi dialogues, the scenes were well applauded by all because of Anuja’s powerful performance.
The one-woman show revolved around an actress who is haunted by the ghost of her great-grandfather, a late 19th century female impersonator.
Chief guest Naresh Saxena, a well-known poet, also enjoyed the play.

The play concluded with a 15 minutes question and answer session in which the keen audience participated with great enthusiasm. ""Though the documentary form of theatre isn’t very much popular among the theatre lovers in India and is not practiced much here, I am really happy that Lucknowites loved our play,"" said Anuja towards the end of the session.

32,Aarushi Nigam,TNN,Hindi,Kruthika Jayakumar had no apprehensions about playing an older woman,"Kruthika Jayakumar is a Bengaluru girl, but the last and only time we saw her in Kannada film was in 2015 (Boxer). Although she’s done some Telugu films in the meantime, she took her time to pick her next Kannada film. Why? “Being born and brought up here, I am more careful with the Kannada films I pick,” Kruthika says. In a breezy chat, she tells us about her role in Kavacha, what she looks for in films and more…
You play a woman much older than yourself in Kavacha…
Yes, I play Revathy, who is a woman aged 35-40 years. Director GVR Vasu didn’t want to rely on makeup to make me look older — he wanted me to actually look the part. So, I had to put on 10-12 kgs. And this I had to do in a very short span on time. I had about 1.5 weeks before shooting began, during which time I put on around 8-10 kgs. I managed to do this by cutting out on exercise and eating non-stop. My body is such that I can put on and lose weight easily, so the challenge was to maintain continuity, but not keep putting on more weight.


So, what’s Revathy like? She works in the same apartment complex as Shivarajkumar’s character. She cares for him a lot and is his main pillar of support. They are both mature characters and there is a silent undercurrent between them.


How did Kavacha happen to you?

Since the director is from Hyderabad, he had seen my work in Telugu films. He first asked me to watch the original (the Malayalam film Oppam) and tell him if I was ready to play the part. I am quite new to the film industry, so being presented with an opportunity like Kavacha was huge for me. A lot of people asked me why I would want to play someone much older than me this early on in my career, but how do you say no to working with Shivanna?


Why the long break in Sandalwood?

I consciously take slow decisions. I get a lot of offers, but I don’t want to do a movie just for the sake of it. I want each movie I do to have some value, and I want to be remembered for them. And I got that with Kavacha. Although I’m not on screen for a long time, I play a key role and add value to the film. Being born and brought up in Bengaluru, I am more careful with the Kannada films I pick."

37,Neha Chaudhary,TNN,Hindi,John Abraham: I am not in the business of trending on social media,"He’s the guy who rages and roars on screen, ripping apart the wrong doers with deadly vengeance that makes you shudder and scream, but it feels real. He walks through the walls and doors, with every sinew in that 100-kilo body, throbbing with energy. And be forewarned, you can’t mess with the man in real life, too. He doesn’t mince words when he says, “It is very difficult to tell me lies and get away with it. There is nothing that will get past me.” His action avatar aside, what John really loves delving into is history and world politics, and understanding how all of that impacts human lives. In a chat with BT, the actor excitedly talks about his upcoming spy thriller, 'RAW (Romeo, Akbar, Walter)', a story that’s inspired by true events from the 1971 Indo-Pak war, his views on social media activism and how he will always stand up and speak his mind, through his stories on celluloid. Read on...
Stories that stem from real incidents and significant episodes in history have always interested you ('Madras Café', 'Parmanu: The Story Of Pokhran', and the upcoming 'Batla House'). So, what clinched it specifically for 'RAW'? Also, the mood of the country is different now from what it was a year ago, post the heinous Pulwama attack. Hence, films with a political backdrop need to be doubly sure that they are touching the right chord with the audience. Would you agree?
I read the script and I wanted to do it, I knew this was a fantastic story. I was fortunate that Robbie Grewal (writer-director) approached me, though he didn’t expect me to do it. The minute I heard it, I was floored and the first thing I told him was that this is not flaky stuff; the film is so well-researched. Robbie has grown up in an army background; his father was part of the military intelligence, so the subject is close to his heart. Both Robbie and I are intrinsically India lovers. The good thing is that this film is not jingoistic or overtly patriotic. It does not get into the zone of bashing other countries, it is a thriller. Just like 'Raazi', which was after all a human story, this one is, too. Unfortunately for us, the film is releasing post the Pulwama attacks. It has been in the making for a year. In fact, it was always meant to release between March 15 and April 12, you can find it mentioned in the industry trade magazines. We pushed the date ahead to April 5. We know that unfortunately, the film resonates with the mood of the country, but it’s not pre-planned.

'RAW' is inspired by true events, and set against the backdrop of the Indo-Pak war of 1971. How much have you personally researched the events that happened during that period? And while doing that, did it throw up interesting insights and give you a different perspective on the subject?
When I hear stories about wars from people in general, they mostly come from a space of ignorance, pardon me for saying this. In this case, a huge amount of research has gone into the film; I give all credit to Robbie for it. On my part, I think the fact that I am politically aware and I know what has historically happened in the world around us, helps while telling such stories. Subjects like 'Madras Café', 'Parmanu: The Story Of Pokhran', 'Batla House' and 'RAW' is the space that I dwell in. We shot this film in Kashmir, in the middle of a shootout that happened during Eid. We know and understand the mood of the region and are aware of the history of what has happened there for a long time. When you make a film on a sensitive subject, you have to be very responsible in your storytelling. You cannot fudge anything, or take creative liberties, it has to be factual. My biggest source of information was of course, Robbie and all that he had gathered from his father. Other than that, I have read numerous books on the pre-Partition and post-Partition eras. I generally read a lot on such subjects, so if you ask me about what’s happening in Syria, Ecuador, Venezuela or any other part of the world, I am well-informed. I like understanding why there is conflict, where it is coming from and what is the root of it all. You understand all this, process it, and then, when you read Twitter hashtags that tell you… say yes to this, say no to that, I feel bad. You need to have the right information before Tweeting and commenting on such serious issues.
Yes, social media commentary is common these days and it is often misleading. There is no dearth of armchair activists on social media platforms, people who have an opinion on most issues and dole out advice on various subjects. There are some who genuinely make an impact, but a huge number of them say things out of line to simply draw attention…
I would say that it is dangerous. If you are saying something that is sensitive, you rather not say it if you are not backed by the knowledge to comment on the subject. The most dangerous thing in this world is low IQ and high confidence. It can’t get worse than that.

While you might have strong views on pertinent issues and you are well-informed, one does not see you participating in debates, discussions, or commenting on burning issues (political, social or otherwise) on such forums...
I keep telling people that I am not in the business of trending on social media. I do not want to be in a space where I have to be in the news and say something exceptional that will trend. In our line of work, things have changed so much. Earlier, a producer would take you to a hoarding in Juhu and tell you, ‘Look, here is where you are’. Now, the same producer says, ‘Look, you are trending at number one and you are tracking so well’. It might make some actors happy, but I have seen film promotions that have got the fastest 100 million views online, but then, what’s happened to some of those films after they hit the theatres? I feel that a good film will always find its audience. So, my point is, just make a good film, and don’t worry how it is tracking, trending or anything else.

You have backed good films as a producer and made brave choices with movies that went on to make a mark at the box office. Do you think that made industry folks build more faith in you as an actor, too?
Yes, people take my word for it and I am very responsible with my words. If I tell a certain studio that this content is good, they take my word for it, as they trust my instinct and know that I would be saying the right thing. I think I have worked hard for that. Ever since I turned producer, I have always gone with my instinct and taken risks. We released 'Parmanu: The Story Of Pokhran' during the IPL semi-finals, it was like committing hara-kiri. I had gone through a court case with the producer (Prerna Arora), but I saw that release through and it taught me a lot. I learnt a lot about the legal process and how things work in court. I learnt a lot about distribution and about everything else under the sun. In some of my interviews during that time, I had said that it is very difficult to tell John lies and get away with it. There is nothing that can fool me or will get past me.

You took a strong stand and fought it out in court, and others followed...
(Cuts in)… I will always take a stand, even as an actor when I am working on my movies. I am not one of those politically correct actors who is pro-India, but will not say anything that will antagonise anybody. I won’t make a political statement just to trend on social media, but I will say things as they are, as they are meant to be said and I will say it through my films.


You recently said that looking ahead, you can see your best five years coming up (as an actor and producer). The fact that the audience’s appetite for cinema is growing, actors are getting greedier for better and well-written roles and that there is a plethora of options for actors to choose from, has a huge role to play in the benchmark you have set for your career goals. Right?

Yes, even going ahead, I will only develop content. I will work with the new Ayushmanns (Khurrana) of the world and new directors. I will give them opportunities, and at the end of the day, who will be the hero? The content. Nothing else will drive the film other than good content. I look at it from the audience’s perspective, as I converse a lot with my audience. Why did I become a producer in the first place? For two reasons, firstly, as an actor, I wasn’t getting the kind of films that I wanted to do. Secondly, I wasn’t getting to watch the kind of films I wanted to watch as an audience. If you see my trajectory as an actor before I turned producer and post that, there is a quantum leap. It is because I am doing films which I am convinced that I am meant to do, and I am saying this with all humility. I am a learner, I have learnt through the process. I couldn’t understand the garish performances and overacting that was considered good acting when I first came into the industry, where my subtle acting was considered underacting. People would think, ‘He is not acting’. Today, that subtle acting is considered good. The audience’s tastes have changed and we are at that inflection point, where there is need for content, new-age cinema, subtleties in performances, and everything I am here for.


Even while you are doing these content-heavy films, I assume that you would still want to be seen as Action Abraham, the kickass action hero, right? Also, today, the action in our films has gone notches higher (as far as skill, technique and style are concerned). Do you see it scaling up even further?
You could do the best action in this country, but it will not work if you don’t connect emotionally with the story. If the EQ (emotional quotient) is good and the action is average, your film will still do wonders. So, I feel that movies here still run on emotions, not on great action. Think of this…who are your biggest action heroes? Bruce Willis, Sylvester Stallone, Dwayne Johnson, Arnold Schwarzenegger, these are the massive action heroes of Hollywood. What is common between all of them? None of them can really do action…it is their attitude that makes them such huge action heroes. When Arnold says, ‘I will be back’, it’s the way he says it that stays with you. It is the attitude that makes an action hero, not the action itself.


Given how involved you are in every aspect of filmmaking, you must have given some thought to the idea of turning director, too?
Yes, I have. I will direct someday. I get a lot of hope when I see films directed by artistes like Bradley Cooper, Clint Eastwood and Robert Redford. They are actors who are also such fine directors, they inspire me."
38,Neha Maheshwri,TNN,Music,Chuck Russell: I couldn’t do the movie unless the elephants were safe and happy,"Chuck Russell ‘directed’ a real elephant herd for the first time in his life for 'Junglee'. He tells us that it was very important for him that the elephants were comfortable and happy, which is why he brought no animal trainers along with him for the shoot – the default Hollywood way. Chuck wanted to work only with the elephants and their mahouts, which elicited grim warnings from his Hollywood colleagues. But for the director, the journey which began in fear soon transformed into respect, and then love. “I’ve worked with a guy who’s a legend in Hollywood, Sled Reynolds (animal trainer Paul ‘Sled’ Reynolds) who did 'Tarzan', 'The Ape Man' (1981) with Bo Derek, he did 'The Scorpion King' for me. He was kind of a mentor for me in working with animals, and he told me, ‘Chuck, do not go out there and think you’re the elephant whisperer. They are very dangerous, wild animals’. He wanted me to take some of his trainers with me and he basically made me promise not to get too close to the elephants. Because elephants can kill you accidentally,” says Chuck, and then adds with a chuckle, “I haven’t sent him the trailer yet, ‘coz he’s going to kill me! I did tell him that I wanted to work with the mahouts, and he just... This is the Hollywood thinking, and Sled is a master. But 'Junglee' is a different situation. This is a real herd of elephants, with each having a mahout that stays with his/her elephant for life. So this was a much more naturalistic approach to shooting elephants.”


What fears did he bring with him? “From the beginning, I knew it was dangerous,” replies Chuck, “Our protocols were developed one step at a time until I felt it was safe. Vidyut was always at the lead because he’s got his own opinion about what is safe, but around the animals, it was only respect. I didn’t tell them when to work, they told me. We earned their trust first, and then I was amazed at the things that happened between them. So it was a slow process, I was there a couple of weeks before we started filming, Vidyut spent a couple of weeks just with Bhola. And then we brought the rest of the crew in.”


He adds, “By the time we were done, we knew what he liked, we knew his apples. Bhola does not let other people approach him. Just his mahout, and Vidyut and fortunately, myself, thanks to the time we spent together. So this was a legit wildlife adventure. I couldn’t do a movie about my love for elephants and the fact that we could lose them, unless the elephants I worked with were truly safe, happy and enjoyed working on our set.”"
39,"Created: Apr 2, 2019, 01:45 IST",TNN,Music,Hunar Gandhi: Can’t differentiate between Delhi and Gurgaon,"Hunar Gandhi calls herself a Delhi girl. Her association with the national capital is quite old. The 'Patiala Babes' actress has lived and shot for two shows ('Dahleez' and '12/24 Karol Bagh') in Delhi, and now owns a house in Gurgaon with actor-husband Mayank Gandhi. Although Delhi and Gurgaon are far from similar, to Hunar, it’s all the same. “For those of us who come from Bombay, Gurgaon is Delhi. I still cannot differentiate between the two,” she says, “It has happened so many times that I’d come to our Gurgaon house and someone from my in-laws would say, ‘Main Delhi jaa raha hoon’, and I’d say, ‘Hum Delhi mein hi toh hain’. But now, after spending more time here, I know it’s a separate city.” Hunar laments that she hasn’t explored Gurgaon as much as Delhi. “I know Delhi quite well. I shot in places like Karol Bagh and Chhatarpur, so I know the food and the people very well. But I haven’t had a chance to explore Gurgaon. When I go somewhere new, I always gorge on the city’s food first. The street food shops in Gurgaon will be my first stop.”




Hunar has some fond memories of shooting in Delhi, particularly the outdoor shoots in Karol Bagh. “I remember we once shot at Ajmal Khan Road with a hidden camera set-up, and it was so fun because people didn’t know we were shooting,” she recounts, adding, “Bas Delhi ki ek baat buri hai. Yahan stalkers bahut aa jaate hain. And I don’t know how, but logon ko yahan phone number bhi badi jaldi mil jaate hain aapke.” On the work front, Hunar’s role of ‘the other woman’ Meeta in 'Patiala Babes', is being appreciated by the audience. She says, “I knew this role had to be different from the usual other women roles you see in soaps, and I’m glad I have been able to bring that out. I wanted her to be a well-rounded human being, and not just shades of black or white. I am happy that it is being appreciated by the audience. When have you ever seen people sympathizing with the other woman in a TV show?”"

The accident took place after the main junction box installed outside the passage blew up. Fortunately, timely intervention averted a major tragedy.
The incident took place around 3.30 am when everyone was asleep. Tannaz shudders as she recalls the incident, “Bhakhtyar and I were sleeping in our room, when our househelp called me from the children’s room, inquiring about the power cut. I asked Bhakhtyar to look into it and within a few minutes of him stepping out, I heard him scream. He is not the one to panic easily. So, I rushed out, and was shocked to see fire in the passage. There were huge flames and smoke reaching inside the house. Fortunately, our neighbour helped us diffuse it by using blankets and kitchen napkins. Bhakhtyar was a real-life hero; he managed to bring the fire down after working relentlessly for 45 minutes. Thankfully, the fire brigade and police also came in time.”



The actress adds, “This has been a big lesson for us. Every home should have a fire extinguisher. Now, we don’t have power supply, and I have sent the kids and dog to my mother-in-law’s home, which is close by, to catch up on some sleep.”

Tannaz and Bhakhtyar had informed their friends and well-wishers about the accident on social media. On a lighter note, the actress shares, “Given that the incident took place on April 1, many people thought that we were fooling them. Finally, when they realised that we were speaking the truth, they were shocked.”"

Jaipur is a fascinating city steeped in history and culture. Every time I come here, it takes me to an epoch of royalty and tradition. I also love the rich and diverse accommodation that the city offers, from havelis to luxurious palaces.”

The song addresses the issue of drunken driving. Opening up on her love for independent music, the singer tells us, “I have come from independent music. My debut pop album Ho Gayi Hai Mohabbat is still fresh in people’s memories. It is something that I connect with. Independent music gives me more liberty and freedom to express myself, which I don’t think is the case with Bollywood music. It’s not in your control.”

42,"Created: Apr 3, 2019, 00:00 IST",V Lakshmi,Hollywood,Is it possible to find true bonds on social media?,"Finding true relationships —friends or lovers — in general, is hard. While you might find a good friend or true lover by hanging out with him or her in person, people often wonder if having a network of contacts on social media, who you have never met, can be called friends, too. Are social media relations as deep and meaningful as long-standing friendships in the real world?

With the soaring popularity of such platforms, people tend to communicate less in person and more online. According to a recent American study, 76 per cent teenagers use social media. While some might assume that online relationships are transient, fleeting and shallow, others feel that sometimes you can be more honest with a social media friend, than communicating with someone directly. That’s because, though the mediums are different, the bond you share with someone online is as intense as it would be with someone you meet.
“Social media and dating apps are excellent avenues to find new companions. But often, it is equated to finding a friend with benefits. If you find someone who seems genuine, make sure you don’t get physically or financially involved. Be it friendship or love, it’s best to take things slow, initially,” says Dr Rohann Bokdawala, psychiatrist.

Trust is the key
Even when you communicate with someone on a digital medium, there’s still human interaction. If you like talking to someone on social media and you share common interests and topics you’re passionate about, you may have found a true relation.



City-based Anuradha Tiwari has been friends with Saemah Khan for over a decade. They connected on a social networking site via a mutual friend and their bond turned into long-lasting friendship. “Saemah is like a sister to me. When we interacted for the first time, we argued over a mutual friend’s post. But later, we clicked and became best of friends. We met for the first time at Bandra station for five minutes, and bonded well. We have been by each other’s side through thick and thin. Her family loves me and vice versa,” says Anuradha, who feels that trust, time and patience are the key ingredients for finding the right bond on social media.

Experts say it’s important to trust your gut when you are bonding with a person on social media. If you like talking to him or her, be frank about who you are. You can’t start a friendship or bond based on pretenses. Saemah says that their mutual understanding and willingness to hear each other out worked when they connected on a social networking site. Explaining how they trusted each other, Saemah adds, “When we realised that we don’t judge each other for what we say or opine, the trust strengthened. I feel every bond, whether it’s with someone you meet regularly or a social media contact, takes time. So, we started meeting occasionally, mostly on birthdays, and our friendship bloomed with every meeting. I loved her honesty and our wavelength matched.”

Is it love?
While some find true friends on social media, some find true love and subsequent life partners, too. Pooja Advani, a PR professional from Mumbai, connected with Omkar Pawaskar on social media in 2015. They fell in love and eventually, got married.



“We met after chatting for a month on the site. The first meeting was awkward for both of us, but we got along in subsequent meetings. We realised that our choices in terms of food and music, and expectations from life, were similar. We were always transparent in the relationship when we chatted on social media, and that reflected when we met, too,” says Pooja.


Another Mumbaikar, Tanya Chopra connected with Rahul Sharma on a dating app. She never knew that she would end up marrying the guy. “I connected with Rahul in 2014. I was speaking to another guy at the same time and had spoken to a couple of them before as well. After a point, the conversation gets boring with the repeated questions, like ‘How are you?’ and ‘What are your hobbies?’ It’s the same drill. But with Rahul, it was different. He didn’t start the conversation with the usual. He asked me what my political views were, what I am like as a person. His knowledge and intelligence intrigued me and made me want to know him more,” she says.


Don’t play around
It’s important to stay patient and not play around with sentiments on social networking sites if you want to find a true relationship. “When you start a relationship online, you have doubts. I was skeptical when Rahul and I started talking, because some men I connected with offered to meet me in my building at midnight after a 5-minute conversation. There were some who asked for my personal number a few seconds after connecting on social media. But Rahul did none of this. He gave me the time to get comfortable talking to him and opening up to him. We developed a strong bond and trust, and now, we are married,” says Tanya.




If your areas of interest are common and your wavelengths match, striking a bond isn’t difficult. City-based celebrity manager Mona Jaswani found one of her closest friends four years ago on a photo-sharing social network. They bonded over their common spiritual beliefs. “We connected over spirituality, something which is quite unconventional when it comes to the younger generation. After knowing each other for a while, we realised that both of us were looking for a companion to connect with on the spiritual front. We didn’t exchange numbers and continued to chat on the site for months. The first time he invited me to meet was at a satsang (prayer meeting). I was surprised. We started going on walks and the topics we discussed included Lord Shiva, work and fitness,” she says."

44,"Created: Apr 3, 2019, 00:00 IST",Joyeeta Chakravorty,Movies,"Aasif Sheikh: Jo kabhi zindagi mein nahi mila hai, woh ab mil raha hai. How can I slow down now?","At 55, Aasif Sheikh is in an enviable position. While many of his peers have either been relegated to doing insignificant roles, or faded into oblivion, the actor has managed to stay relevant. Defying the norm of younger faces playing heroes on TV, Aasif is the lead on the show, 'Bhabiji Ghar Par Hai!'
He says, “The show has given me a new lease of life. Usually, an actor my age makes peace with the fact that he would be reduced to playing just papa and chacha on screen. I was also losing hope and had in a way prepared myself to wear the usual kurta pajama and stand behind an array of actors. However, I would still pray to God for that one opportunity where I had the scope to perform. A meaty role like Vibhuti’s (his character in 'Bhabiji...') is unthinkable. My life revolves around this show. I reach home after the shoot, spend an hour with my family over dinner, hit the bed and go back to work the next day. But they all understand that it is worth the effort.”

He adds, “My kids tell me to take it easy and slow down because I am 55 and yet running around. I tell them that I can’t. Jo kabhi zindagi mein nahi mila hai, woh ab mil raha hai. How can I slow down now? I have earned name, fame and money through this show. I will act till the time I can remember my lines.”

Besides Vibhuti, Aasif has played over 250 characters and around 20 variations of a woman on the show. It’s the variety in the role that keeps him on his toes. He says, “Among other female characters, I have played Amrapali and a Chinese woman. After 1,200 episodes, there isn’t much left in the story to explore, so, we explore the characters. It’s always funny to see a man transform into a woman and I look good as a woman (laughs!). I have all shapes and sizes of clothes required to become a woman stored in my make-up room. In fact, my wife inquired about the eight pairs of sandals in my room when she visited the set once and I told her that they belonged to me. She was scandalised. I can play the quintessential heroine for a few episodes on a daily soap (laughs!). It takes me around four hours to dress like a woman, as I am very particular about my look. I sit with the team to finalise the look of the character I am playing.”


The actor featured as a hero in films like 'Rama O Rama' (1988) and 'Yaara Dildara' (1991) and then hit a low. But he has no regrets over the slow phase in his career. He shares, “I like to move on and not regret anything in life. I started as a hero and did a few films, but there was no work for a few years. I played negative characters and bagged a role in 'Karan Arjun' (1995), which changed my life for the better. Life is a journey and I like to enjoy it. Earlier, I was seen as a decent performer, but this show has put me on a pedestal. It’s an overwhelming feeling. I am proud of what I am doing at this age. Ab return mil raha hai saalon ke hard work ka.”


While several youngsters prefer to take up finite shows after a long stint on a daily soap, Aasif says, “The idea to leave Bhabiji... has never crossed my mind. Finite or infinite, actors need to understand that they are playing characters on TV. It’s up to them to keep themselves amused and immersed in the character. I have been doing that since four years.”


The show hit a roadblock when Shilpa Shinde, the original Angoori bhabhi, decided to quit the show three years ago. Aasif says, “I was the one who recommended Shilpa for that role. I had worked with her for a month on 'Chidiyaghar' and believed that she fit the bill. It was indeed a difficult time when she quit the show. But let me tell you, no one is indispensable on TV. The show will go on, maybe, the number of eyeballs will decrease. Things became alright after Shubhangi Atre joined as the new Angoori bhabhi. I feel the content makes a show and not just one character. Logon ke saath saath Shilpa ki bhi galat fehmi thi ki ek character show ko chalaata hai. She even told me, ‘I am the one who runs the show. Mere jaane ke baad show dekhna band ho jayega’. I told her that it was her biggest mistake to think like that. I am assuming she was being misguided by people. Of course, she was the most popular character on the show and her exit hit us. It took us around four months to recover.”"

Ahead of the release, Mark Ruffalo who plays the role of Hulk in the film took to his Instagram to share a spoiler video of the film. He captioned, the video, ""25 days until #AvengersEndgame! Ask and you shall receive. Here’s a spoiler...""


Well, he didn't share any spoiler for real, he just fooled everyone as it's April Fool's Day.

Here's the video:



Helmed by Joe Russo and Anthony Russo, the film is all set to hit the theatres on April 26."
46,"Created: Apr 3, 2019, 00:00 IST",V Lakshmi,Movies,Joe Russo: I wouldn't be standing here without Stan Lee,"Stan Lee may not be here to see Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU)) complete an important milestone with the release of 'Avengers: Endgame', but director Joe Russo on Monday told Indian fans that being a part of the world created by the comic genius was a dream come true for him.

Lee passed away on November 12 at 95, and Russo said 'Endgame' has one of his final cameo appearances.


""I wouldn't be standing here without him. I believe one of his final cameo is in 'Endgame.' I don't remember if he was well enough to do the Spider-Man cameo. But it was incredible,"" Russo said at the launch of the Hindi version of the Marvel Anthem composed by music maestro A R Rahman, who was also present at the event.
The Tamil and Telugu versions will release soon.

""I grew up on his comic books. Stan Lee was my idol when I was a kid. To be able to have the opportunity to not only work on the material that he created but to work with him is a childhood dream come true,"" he added.

The makers for the film, including the Marvel Studios bosses, have always been strict with their 'no spoilers' policy and Russo appealed to the fans to not kill the movie for others as it is a product of seven years of hardwork.

""Thanos demands your silence,"" he quipped.

The director told fans to be prepared for ""more stakes"" after the finger snap by Thanos wiped out half of the population of the world including some of the superheroes.

Mark Ruffalo, who plays the Hulk in the MCU, had famously blurted out the end of 'Infinity War' and Russo revealed that this time they took extra measures to protect the secrets, including not sharing the script with the cast.

""Here's the thing. I'll take any questions about 'Endgame' but I'm not going to answer any question on the plot of 'Endgame'! Three years of protecting the plot from Tom Holland and Mark Ruffalo, so I'm not going to stand here and give away about the film. But I appreciate and admire your effort,"" he said.

The director acknowledged the fan mania around the films by saying, ""Here is the thing about Marvel fans, they read between the lines in everything"".

Talking about how they protected the secrets from Holland, who had in the past accidentally shared the details about his upcoming film 'Spider-Man: Far From Home', Russo said they never gave the script to the young actor.

""Tom Holland does not get the script! He gets his lines, and that's all, along with who is acting opposite him. Then we use very vague terms to describe what's happening in the scene,"" he added.

Praising the Indian version of the Marvel Anthem, Russo said he had ""goosebumps"" when he first heard the track.

""I felt it represented the spirit of he film, which you can't express in words. Which is why Rahman is a musical genius.""

The Oscar-winning composer said creating the anthem for the Avengers was an honour for him.

""It was a great honour to compose this track for Avengers India. When I was briefed about the story, it resonated with me.""


He added that his son helped him in understanding the spirit of the Marvel superheroes.
""My son is a bigger fan of Marvel than I am. So I went to him and asked, 'what do you think?' he said 'good daddy!' I look at his eyes and find the spirit.""

""My favourite Marvel superheroes are Iron Man and Black Panther. Favourite superhero movie would be 'Black Panther', because it's new.""

When asked if 'Endgame' composer Alan Silvestri gave him some input for the song, Rahman said, ""No. This entire track was conceived, reviewed and shot here in ten days. I didn't show it him. He finished his score just recently is what I believe. This song is for the Indian audience.""

Russo, who has co-directed 'Endgame' with brother Anthony, is in India to promote ""Endgame"". The movies mark the final film within the MCU's current generation of superheroes.


It features an ensemble cast of Robert Downey Jr, Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Don Cheadle, Paul Rudd, Brie Larson, Karen Gillan, Danai Gurira, Bradley Cooper, Tessa Thompson and Josh Brolin

Dipen Mitra, the proprietor of Mitra cinema — an iconic theatre in north Kolkata — turned up in crisp white dhoti-kurta and wore a smile to greet a motley group of movie lovers. He offered a platter of korapaaker sandesh and said it would be a huge loss for those who didn’t savour them. He showed rare pictures of old Kolkata and reminisced the golden era of Bengali cinema. Though he didn’t speak of his decision to close the theatre that day, he did say he was concerned about what would happen to it after he’s gone. The theatre, which was earlier known as Chitra cinema, changed hands and began its journey as Mitra in 1963. After decades of running movies of Satyajit Ray, Mrinal Sen, Ritwik Ghatak and many contemporaries, it downed shutters at the beginning of the month. With it, more single screens seem to be staring at a bleak future. In a brief chat, Dipen Mitra talks about his decision that has proved how April is indeed the cruellest month. Excerpts:
What made you decide to down shutters?

As we speak, I’m sitting at a hospital for a check-up. I’ve been ailing for quite some time now and didn’t want to pass my burden onto others. When people ask me, ‘How are you doing Dipenda?’, I tell them, ‘First class!’ But I’ve developed quite a few problems. I invested `20 lakh recently to renovate the theatre, but health issues started cropping up one after the other.
What about your family?

I asked my sister-in-law about the problem. She too isn’t keeping well and can’t walk much. Then I asked my nephew if he would take responsibility of the theatre. My mother didn’t get me married. I had told her many times that fix a match for me, but that never happened (laughs). But she left me without foreseeing this future. Jokes apart, I asked my nephew, who is a chartered accountant and lives in Gurgaon. He has a demanding job and he clearly told me neither could he shift here nor did the family business interest him. He said he would ask a legal firm to look into the matter. What I realised after talking to them was that my employees would incur great losses if they took charge. I called my employees and asked them, ‘Tora ki korbi bol?’ They said they were ready to sign legal papers should I ask them to. I spoke to the lawyers and drafted an MoU. I summoned an employee and asked him to read it out to the rest. ‘Tui toh porashona korechhish, pore shona,’ I told him. He said if I’d read it, they had no problems with it. They left the papers on my table. I’ve cleared all their dues. They said, ‘Sir, apni ki korben?’ They are worried about me. Frankly, if anyone wants to run this theatre, I’d be more than happy.

What do you plan to do with the theatre?

As of now, I don’t know. My nephew has asked me to sell it off. I am 75. At this age, I’m not getting married and I don’t need to worry about my wife or kids! My brother passed away at an early age. All I have is my sister-in-law, nephew and his family.

Will you from now on lead a retired life?

I was never into any service, so there’s no question of retirement. I have nothing to gain or lose. About what I’ll do in future, only time will tell. See, my idea was never to close this theatre. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have spent a huge amount on changing the transformer and upgrading the sound system. Only this morning, the air-conditioner maintenance person turned up at my door. Till I’m alive, I’ll keep maintaining the building. I am worried about my employees.

What was the last running film?

Kesari. A lot of people are writing on social media that Mitra is turning into a mall, but fact is, I haven’t sold the theatre yet. These days, rumours spread very fast. Someone asked me why I was going to a hospital in the morning and said he would fix up an appointment with a cardiac surgeon. I said I don’t have a heart problem. I don’t know why people can’t let others be!

Film frat mourns the closing of iconic theatre

‘Single screens are losing out to plexes in Kolkata’

Dipenda’s character is akin to the one I showed in Cinemawala. I, in fact, used his trophies in the film. I share a long association with him. When my first film, Waarish, released, he had come for its private screening at a south Kolkata theatre. He was so moved that he blessed me for the film. I’ve been to his theatre for many films. Nagarkirtan was running there recently and I visited the theatre after Drishtikone’s release last year. Every time I went there, he would treat me to cutlets. Fact is, single screens are losing out to plexes in Kolkata. They can’t give the wholesome experiences that plexes can now give — there’s no window-shopping involved and it doesn’t give you the false feeling of a Singapore trip. It’s very sad for Bengali cinema and I just hope the theatre reopens soon.
— Kaushik Ganguly, filmmaker

‘There’s no charity involved in the business of cinema’

Last year went well for Mitra. I know that as I visited the theatre after the release of Uma and Ek Je Chhilo Raja. Dipenda treated me to sweets and said those were available only in north Kolkata. About this year, I’m not too sure. He is a khandaani businessman and this news came as a big blow. At a time when a plot of land in Kolkata comes at a premium, it may be commercially more viable to exploit a big property. There’s no charity involved in the business of cinema. I’m only
hoping that if a multi-storeyed building comes up in its place, there should be one floor to screen films.
— Srijit Mukherji, filmmaker

‘This is a huge blow for Bengali cinema’

I share an old association with Dipenda. The first time I got involved with distribution was when Rituparno Ghosh made Unishe April. I knew the film could not be accommodated in Mitra and the team was heartbroken. Some of my films like Sudhu Tumi and Cross Connection have run there. I’d often visit the place and tell Dipenda, ‘Get married now.’ It’s such a theatre where Mon Janena can run, much like Cross Connection or Haami. So, it’s a mixed audience. For me, it’d be a reality check every time I went there. Dipenda doesn’t mince words and he’d tell me where a film stood. This is a huge blow for Bengali cinema.

— Sudeshna Roy, filmmaker


‘I don’t know what is the reason behind this’

It’s a big loss for the film industry. I don’t know what is the reason behind this. As a single theatre, Mitra holds an important place in Kolkata. It also has an audience. I am hoping the authorities will have a dialogue and work towards resolving this deadlock.

51,"Created: Apr 3, 2019, 00:00 IST",Joyeeta Chakravorty,Kannada,Meet Bengaluru's acid attack survivor who is an inspiration to many,"In 2006, a beautiful 23-year-old Pragya Prasun was subjected to her worst nightmare. Barely 10 days after she got married, a jilted lover threw acid on her face. Ever since, her life has been about accepting the truth and trying to move ahead. Now, 35-year-old Pragya, who recently won the Nari Shakti Puraskar — the highest civilian award given to women in India — talks to us about her journey from a meek and conflicted acid attack victim to a survivor and a beacon of hope for many.
‘My foundation was born out of my greatest sorrow’
Her struggle with burns and rehabilitation made Pragya rethink her life goals. “I was lucky to be from an educated and a financially-stable family, who asked the right questions. But while I was undergoing treatment in hospital, I saw a lot of burn victims, who were losing hope, as there was no one to guide them. So, I decided to help them. I started guiding them to the right doctor and giving them information about their diet and the treatments for scars,” she says. In a bid to help burn victims ask the right question and seek help at the right places, Pragya started an NGO, which has rehabilitated more than 200 acid attack victims across the country. From guiding patients to conducting burn camps, where nearly 25 surgeries for burns patients across the country are done in 3-4 days, her foundation (started in 2013) has come a long way. “Other than that, we get surgeries done for the patients one by one or in a group of 2-3 patients throughout the year in Bengaluru, Chennai, Delhi and Mumbai. The surgery count goes up till 3-4 each month. For four years, we have also been getting laser treatment and hair transplant done for 1-2 patients every month,” she adds.

‘I tried to push my husband away’
With 47% burns and hypertrophic scars all over, it was anything but easy going for Pragya after the attack. “I was a newly-married woman and barely 12 days into my marital life when I was attacked. To look at myself like that in the mirror impacted me deeply. I thought that my marriage would not sustain, as the first three years were difficult. I felt guilty about messing up my husband’s life and I tried to push him away. But he has been very supportive and has taken good care of me,” says Pragya. “I had suffered two miscarriages and was not in a good mind space, but after my first daughter was born in 2009, my life changed. She was the positivity in my life,” she says.

‘It is definitely not easy for my daughter’

But even with a positive family, all has not been rosy for Pragya or her two daughters, as society has been harsh on them. “It used to be extremely difficult to just take my daughters to the playground or drop them at school, as parents would look away from us and even pull their children away. At school, my daughters are asked, ‘Why does your mother look like a ghost?’ But both my daughters are now strong and have developed coping skills,”

says Pragya, who feels that society is yet to become more accepting of acid attack victims.


‘Hope Chappak makes people more accepting of acid attack survivors’

This is why Pragya hopes that Deepika Padukone’s film with Meghna Gulzar, titled Chappak, is a changemaker. Chappak is based on an acid attack survivor. “I am glad that Deepika and a seasoned director like Meghna Gulzar have picked the issue of acid attacks as a subject for their film. I was amazed to see the first look. At the same time, I lament that the makeup Deepika wore for the movie is an everyday reality for many like me. I

sincerely hope that the way people accept her in the movie is how they accept real-life survivors. I hope that the awareness this creates highlights the menace of acid attack in the society and is, therefore, eradicated from our world forever.”"

When it didn’t happen, one of them flung a beer mug at me,” Akshay recalls, adding that he is set to file a complaint against the offender. “This was a night that came with a prior warning. It was called Undressed Comedy and the guests knew that there would be some sexually explicit jokes. Through the course of the night, there were some jokes that centred on pedophilia,” explains Akshay.

Akshay adds. “I guess the jokes got the better of them and since I was the last act, they tried to ask for some kind of an apology, but seeing none coming, the mug was hurled at me in frustration.”

The incident was shared by Akshay on his Facebook page, which was how many other comics heard of it and then condemned the act. Sanjay Manaktala points out, “It is not uncommon for someone to take offence to jokes. But the best feedback in comedy is laughter and these guys could have kept quiet. Inciting violence is definitely not right. And the people who are being accused here are definitely not uneducated. I have seen a similar incident once. I was waiting for my turn for a show in Singapore, where there was another person on stage before me. He was making fun of Australians and their drinking habits, when one of the members took offence and threw a beer bottle. The audience member, luckily for me, was taken out before I went on stage. But at such shows, it is hard to know when someone is offended and how they would react.”

Danish Sait, too, adds that this incident is unacceptable. “People need to stop being righteous. When they have gone to a night that has stand-up comedy, they understand that comedy is a heightened state of a regular situation. If one doesn’t agree to the jokes, the best is to get up and leave. Just because one has paid, no one will dance to your tunes. A comic usually prepares a set of jokes that he likes. Hecklers, who are just trolls from the online world in real life, are always around,” he adds.

But how does one learn to handle these hecklers? “It takes a lot of practice. I have seen a lot of senior comics like Sorabh Pant go from ignoring to addressing them to now just asking them to shut up and not ruin the show,” says Danish. Sanjay adds, “Another thing most comics end up doing is building their own network. All of us have friends in the legal sector and other corporate bodies.”"

The film is an official remake of Bollywood flick Pink, which starred Amitabh Bachchan and Taapsee. While Ajith has stepped into Amitabh’s shoes, Shraddha Srinath will be playing Taapsee’s role. The film also stars Vidya Balan, Andrea Tariang (who’s reprising her role from the original), Abirami Venkatachalam, Adhik Ravichandran and Delhi Ganesh.

We spoke to Gourov Dasgupta, who was in Bengaluru recently, about his love for the city, indie artistes and more. Excerpts:
Bengaluru’s music scene has changed over the years
When I used to live in Bengaluru, rock music was at its best. I had come down to the city to watch Iron Maiden perform live. A lot has changed now, though. But that’s the case everywhere. DJs have taken over and people like chill-out music and proper musicians have slowly ventured in to the film industry or are composing for advertisements, because there’s no other way to survive. I have performed at several music

festivals in Bengaluru, and that’s when one could experience the city’s love for music.

Working on remixes is a challenge

Gourov, who recently tasted success with Total Dhamaal, says that remixing a classic requires a lot of work. “It’s extremely challenging because, no matter how hard you work, a certain section will always criticise you and compare it with the original, whereas some will be happy with it. Honestly, as musicians, we would not want to do recreations. I think that’s a global sentiment. But recreations seem to be working because, every record label and every producer wants them. There is something that seems to be clicking with the audience. Probably, the younger generation hasn’t heard the original version and they are enjoying the rehashed version,” says Gourov, adding that, as composers, they try to add their style to any recreation they work on. “Everyone wants to work on original compositions but, sometimes we don’t have a choice. If a record label says that they want this particular thing, one has to do it or else someone else will do it,” says Gourov. But doesn’t that curtail the freedom of a music composer? “It does. But you need to be in a position to decide a lot of things. Thankfully, we are able to strike a balance,” adds Gourov.


Indie artists are getting more exposure today

Unlike earlier, indie artistes today are performing several gigs, says Gourov. “Things are getting better for indie artistes. There are many pop rock bands and other indie acts that are doing well today, but rock music in particular, I’m not sure of. There are so many of them performing at big venues,” he sums up."

Dipen Mitra, the proprietor of Mitra cinema — an iconic theatre in north Kolkata — turned up in crisp white dhoti-kurta and wore a smile to greet a motley group of movie lovers. He offered a platter of korapaaker sandesh and said it would be a huge loss for those who didn’t savour them. He showed rare pictures of old Kolkata and reminisced the golden era of Bengali cinema. Though he didn’t speak of his decision to close the theatre that day, he did say he was concerned about what would happen to it after he’s gone. The theatre, which was earlier known as Chitra cinema, changed hands and began its journey as Mitra in 1963. After decades of running movies of Satyajit Ray, Mrinal Sen, Ritwik Ghatak and many contemporaries, it downed shutters at the beginning of the month. With it, more single screens seem to be staring at a bleak future. In a brief chat, Dipen Mitra talks about his decision that has proved how April is indeed the cruellest month. Excerpts:
What made you decide to down shutters?

As we speak, I’m sitting at a hospital for a check-up. I’ve been ailing for quite some time now and didn’t want to pass my burden onto others. When people ask me, ‘How are you doing Dipenda?’, I tell them, ‘First class!’ But I’ve developed quite a few problems. I invested `20 lakh recently to renovate the theatre, but health issues started cropping up one after the other.
What about your family?

I asked my sister-in-law about the problem. She too isn’t keeping well and can’t walk much. Then I asked my nephew if he would take responsibility of the theatre. My mother didn’t get me married. I had told her many times that fix a match for me, but that never happened (laughs). But she left me without foreseeing this future. Jokes apart, I asked my nephew, who is a chartered accountant and lives in Gurgaon. He has a demanding job and he clearly told me neither could he shift here nor did the family business interest him. He said he would ask a legal firm to look into the matter. What I realised after talking to them was that my employees would incur great losses if they took charge. I called my employees and asked them, ‘Tora ki korbi bol?’ They said they were ready to sign legal papers should I ask them to. I spoke to the lawyers and drafted an MoU. I summoned an employee and asked him to read it out to the rest. ‘Tui toh porashona korechhish, pore shona,’ I told him. He said if I’d read it, they had no problems with it. They left the papers on my table. I’ve cleared all their dues. They said, ‘Sir, apni ki korben?’ They are worried about me. Frankly, if anyone wants to run this theatre, I’d be more than happy.

What do you plan to do with the theatre?

As of now, I don’t know. My nephew has asked me to sell it off. I am 75. At this age, I’m not getting married and I don’t need to worry about my wife or kids! My brother passed away at an early age. All I have is my sister-in-law, nephew and his family.

Will you from now on lead a retired life?

I was never into any service, so there’s no question of retirement. I have nothing to gain or lose. About what I’ll do in future, only time will tell. See, my idea was never to close this theatre. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have spent a huge amount on changing the transformer and upgrading the sound system. Only this morning, the air-conditioner maintenance person turned up at my door. Till I’m alive, I’ll keep maintaining the building. I am worried about my employees.

What was the last running film?

Kesari. A lot of people are writing on social media that Mitra is turning into a mall, but fact is, I haven’t sold the theatre yet. These days, rumours spread very fast. Someone asked me why I was going to a hospital in the morning and said he would fix up an appointment with a cardiac surgeon. I said I don’t have a heart problem. I don’t know why people can’t let others be!

Film frat mourns the closing of iconic theatre

‘Single screens are losing out to plexes in Kolkata’

Dipenda’s character is akin to the one I showed in Cinemawala. I, in fact, used his trophies in the film. I share a long association with him. When my first film, Waarish, released, he had come for its private screening at a south Kolkata theatre. He was so moved that he blessed me for the film. I’ve been to his theatre for many films. Nagarkirtan was running there recently and I visited the theatre after Drishtikone’s release last year. Every time I went there, he would treat me to cutlets. Fact is, single screens are losing out to plexes in Kolkata. They can’t give the wholesome experiences that plexes can now give — there’s no window-shopping involved and it doesn’t give you the false feeling of a Singapore trip. It’s very sad for Bengali cinema and I just hope the theatre reopens soon.
— Kaushik Ganguly, filmmaker

‘There’s no charity involved in the business of cinema’

Last year went well for Mitra. I know that as I visited the theatre after the release of Uma and Ek Je Chhilo Raja. Dipenda treated me to sweets and said those were available only in north Kolkata. About this year, I’m not too sure. He is a khandaani businessman and this news came as a big blow. At a time when a plot of land in Kolkata comes at a premium, it may be commercially more viable to exploit a big property. There’s no charity involved in the business of cinema. I’m only
hoping that if a multi-storeyed building comes up in its place, there should be one floor to screen films.
— Srijit Mukherji, filmmaker

‘This is a huge blow for Bengali cinema’

I share an old association with Dipenda. The first time I got involved with distribution was when Rituparno Ghosh made Unishe April. I knew the film could not be accommodated in Mitra and the team was heartbroken. Some of my films like Sudhu Tumi and Cross Connection have run there. I’d often visit the place and tell Dipenda, ‘Get married now.’ It’s such a theatre where Mon Janena can run, much like Cross Connection or Haami. So, it’s a mixed audience. For me, it’d be a reality check every time I went there. Dipenda doesn’t mince words and he’d tell me where a film stood. This is a huge blow for Bengali cinema.

— Sudeshna Roy, filmmaker


‘I don’t know what is the reason behind this’

It’s a big loss for the film industry. I don’t know what is the reason behind this. As a single theatre, Mitra holds an important place in Kolkata. It also has an audience. I am hoping the authorities will have a dialogue and work towards resolving this deadlock.

59,"Created: Apr 3, 2019, 01:00 IST",Neha Maheshwri,Bollywood,Meet Bengaluru's acid attack survivor who is an inspiration to many,"In 2006, a beautiful 23-year-old Pragya Prasun was subjected to her worst nightmare. Barely 10 days after she got married, a jilted lover threw acid on her face. Ever since, her life has been about accepting the truth and trying to move ahead. Now, 35-year-old Pragya, who recently won the Nari Shakti Puraskar — the highest civilian award given to women in India — talks to us about her journey from a meek and conflicted acid attack victim to a survivor and a beacon of hope for many.
‘My foundation was born out of my greatest sorrow’
Her struggle with burns and rehabilitation made Pragya rethink her life goals. “I was lucky to be from an educated and a financially-stable family, who asked the right questions. But while I was undergoing treatment in hospital, I saw a lot of burn victims, who were losing hope, as there was no one to guide them. So, I decided to help them. I started guiding them to the right doctor and giving them information about their diet and the treatments for scars,” she says. In a bid to help burn victims ask the right question and seek help at the right places, Pragya started an NGO, which has rehabilitated more than 200 acid attack victims across the country. From guiding patients to conducting burn camps, where nearly 25 surgeries for burns patients across the country are done in 3-4 days, her foundation (started in 2013) has come a long way. “Other than that, we get surgeries done for the patients one by one or in a group of 2-3 patients throughout the year in Bengaluru, Chennai, Delhi and Mumbai. The surgery count goes up till 3-4 each month. For four years, we have also been getting laser treatment and hair transplant done for 1-2 patients every month,” she adds.

‘I tried to push my husband away’
With 47% burns and hypertrophic scars all over, it was anything but easy going for Pragya after the attack. “I was a newly-married woman and barely 12 days into my marital life when I was attacked.

With different exercising techniques and diets, college students are fitter than ever and leave no stone unturned to look and feel their best.
Hitting the gym and indulging in sporting activities
For many city students, hitting the gym on a daily basis is a must and this is due to various reasons. “I go to the gym daily and spend at least two hours in there. I was into sports when I was in school and once I came to college, I didn’t want to lose touch with my physical activities. So, I began hitting the gym. In addition to this, I run as well,” says Tarun Kumar, a student of Presidency University. Students don’t just hit the gym, but do exercises depending on their strengths and their goals. “I like to lift weights. I was doing functional training, but realised that I couldn’t do a handstand. I was also losing a lot of weight because I wasn’t eating right. That’s when I stopped functional training and started lifting weights and saw the difference,” says Greeshma Ramesh, a student of St. Joseph’s College of Commerce, who hits the gym six days a week. Today, students love to experiment with different exercising techniques. “I indulge in different forms of workouts like power yoga, aerobics, Tabata and more,” says Preksha Vijay, a student of Nitte Meenakshi Institute of Technology.


Diet plays a crucial role

If you exercise regularly, but don’t follow a diet, it doesn’t serve the purpose, say students, which is why they too follow a strict diet based on their exercise routine. “Diet is a very important aspect of one’s fitness regime. For example, other than hitting the gym, I follow intermittent fasting with a keto diet. Keto requires you to replace carbs with fat. Intermittent fasting is where one fasts for 16 hours and consumes meals in the eight hour window,” says Preksha.

But following a diet is not easy and cheat days too are done keeping in mind the repercussions. “People say that most of your fitness regime is mostly 30% workout and 70% diet. So yes, diet is important, especially when you’re building muscles. I consume calorie-surplus food and make sure that I consume a particular amount of calories every day,” says Tarun, adding that chicken, eggs and other natural proteins are included in his diet on a daily basis. “Following a diet is hard because calories matter and it’s not easy. Even when I have a cheat day, it has to be calories-based. I cannot go overboard. My diet is specific; I consume brown rice, brown bread and chicken breast, in addition to other things,” says Greeshma.


Exercising doesn’t come cheap

Gym subscriptions and following diets are a costly affair and students spend anywhere between `7,000 to `10,000 a month for this. “Along with training fees, protein shakes and supplements, my every month expenditure on my fitness routine is approximately `7,000,” says Preksha. Similarly, Greeshma says that since she follows a strict diet, it does cost her a lot every month. “Since protein powders are expensive, the overall cost of my fitness regime automatically goes up. Since I like having chicken and eggs every day, my per month expenses are anywhere between `5,000 and 7,000,” Greeshma sums up."

We spoke to Gourov Dasgupta, who was in Bengaluru recently, about his love for the city, indie artistes and more. Excerpts:
Bengaluru’s music scene has changed over the years
When I used to live in Bengaluru, rock music was at its best. I had come down to the city to watch Iron Maiden perform live. A lot has changed now, though. But that’s the case everywhere. DJs have taken over and people like chill-out music and proper musicians have slowly ventured in to the film industry or are composing for advertisements, because there’s no other way to survive. I have performed at several music

festivals in Bengaluru, and that’s when one could experience the city’s love for music.

Working on remixes is a challenge

Gourov, who recently tasted success with Total Dhamaal, says that remixing a classic requires a lot of work. “It’s extremely challenging because, no matter how hard you work, a certain section will always criticise you and compare it with the original, whereas some will be happy with it. Honestly, as musicians, we would not want to do recreations. I think that’s a global sentiment. But recreations seem to be working because, every record label and every producer wants them. There is something that seems to be clicking with the audience. Probably, the younger generation hasn’t heard the original version and they are enjoying the rehashed version,” says Gourov, adding that, as composers, they try to add their style to any recreation they work on. “Everyone wants to work on original compositions but, sometimes we don’t have a choice. If a record label says that they want this particular thing, one has to do it or else someone else will do it,” says Gourov. But doesn’t that curtail the freedom of a music composer? “It does. But you need to be in a position to decide a lot of things. Thankfully, we are able to strike a balance,” adds Gourov.


Indie artists are getting more exposure today

Unlike earlier, indie artistes today are performing several gigs, says Gourov. “Things are getting better for indie artistes. There are many pop rock bands and other indie acts that are doing well today, but rock music in particular, I’m not sure of. There are so many of them performing at big venues,” he sums up."

68,"Created: Apr 3, 2019, 00:00 IST",V Lakshmi,Hindi,"I haven’t lost a guru, I have lost my soul! says Prachee Shah Paandya in Lucknow","Actress and kathak dancer Prachee Shah Paandya known for her roles in serials like 'Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi', 'Iss Pyaar Ko Kya Naam Doon..Ek Baar Phir' and more was in Lucknow recently for an event. The actress, who was part of the film 'Mulk' which was shot extensively in Lucknow, says that Lucknow somehow brings out her artistic personality. ""I shot for 'Mulk' which was for around 21 days and starting from having nawabi cuisines on set to chikan shopping, everything was just amazing, I really enjoyed myself. I feel that Lucknow actually brings out the artist in me. Of course, my journey started with Lucknow and Jaipur where I used to come and do stage shows. I feel that somewhere, Lucknow se mera pichhle janm ka naata hai. It has a great vibe and I love wearing chikan suits. I think, given a choice for 365 days I can wear chikan suits and saris. I am not a jeans and a western attire person, so I am happy wearing a chikan kurta and sharara which I think suits me the best. I love the whole feel of the place."" The kathak danseuse and actress who recently lost her guru Ganesh Hiralal ji, of the seventh generation of the Hiralal family of the Jaipur gharana, feels that she has not just lost her guru but someone who taught her to live through dance. Talking about it and getting emotional at the same time, Prachee says, ""The emotions are coming out in bouts because this morning when I woke up I had no one to talk to. He was 82 and for two years he had congestion in his chest. Who would have thought that one day I would wake up and not find him around me. He was someone who was more of a father figure rather than a guru.""

Prachee with her guru late Ganesh Hiralalji (BCCL/ Aditya Yadav)

She adds, ""I haven’t lost a guru, I have lost my soul! I have learnt kathak for about 25 years and maine hamesha se one-on-one seekha hai. I have not attended any class so that bond was even more special. He was 82-years-old and one would not believe that he had performed on vocal padhanth with me till last year in all major festivals whether in India or abroad. So the thought that he is not around is still difficult for me to take in. My father and my husband were there during the funeral ceremony and they kept on sending me pictures, and I was crying continuously. I still can’t imagine that I have lost him because he is somebody who moulded me as a human being right from the way I project myself, the way I dress up and the way I talk. Unka hamesha se kehna tha ki ‘kaam bolna chahiye’, he never believed in outer appearances."" Adding, she says, ""The moment you are on stage whether it is for three hours or three minutes, it’s your entry that says it all. These were his words. The only strength I get while I am on stage is the fact that he is there with me on stage who can easily handle my flaws. And despite being a guru, he never overpowered me on stage. He said that ‘this is your stage, you make the laye, you make the rhythm, you conduct the show and I am there to guide you’. I mean which guru does that? I feel that I am thoroughly blessed to have him in his life. It’s been 25 years and all major festivals in the country or abroad, I have travelled everywhere with him and not once did he say ki ‘main thak gaya hoon ya mujhse nahi hoga’. He was the simplest man who was happy having daal, chawal, roti, sabzi and ice cream was his favourite dessert.""

Prachee Shah Paandya (BCCL/ Aditya Yadav)

""Now I really don’t know how will I be on stage, the fact that he will not be present to teach me and guide me is frightening. All these years he has seen me enter into the phase of a wife to a mother and been there when I was expecting my first child. The entire spiritual aspect in me is totally because of him because he was so spiritual,"" adds the actress who has also done films like Judwaa 2 and Student of The Year. The actress shares that the transition from television to film has been more difficult for her. Talking about her role in Mulk, Prachee says the film gave her a strong recognition in the film fraternity. ""I have been a part of television for more than 20 years so to kind of give you a breakthrough in films with a performance oriented role, I think Mulk has kind of started it for me. And now I can hope to do better films. I have done a complete commercial film like 'Judwaa 2' with David Dhawan ji, which sometimes amazes me ki I have done that film. I fall in such an age group where I neither look 45-50 years old nor 25-30. That is a reason I get to play the roles of mother and I believe playing a mother has a more wide range to it and a longer run career wise. So I am happy I got to do a film like Mulk which challenged me as an actor,"" says Prachee, who says she would love to experiment more with such roles.

69,"Created: Apr 3, 2019, 00:00 IST",Sandra Marina Fernandes,Bollywood,"Joe Russo: Robert Downey Jr acts like a diva, but he is actually the hardest working actor you will ever work with","It cannot get bigger than this. “I am not going to answer any questions on the plot of Endgame. It took me three years to protect it from Tom Holland and Mark Ruffalo, so I am not going to suddenly give it away,” jokes American filmmaker Joe Russo, of the Russo brothers, co-director of the year’s, perhaps, the decade’s most awaited superhero film — Avengers: Endgame, in a candid chat. This is his fourth Marvel film and the twenty-second film in the entirety of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). In Mumbai, to kick-start the film’s promotions, Joe spoke to Bombay Times on Indian influences in the Marvel series, his comic-book fixation, Stan Lee, Robert Downey Jr (RDJ) being nothing like Tony Stark, need for diversity, longevity of superhero films and more.
This is your first visit to India. Take us through your experience so far.
I have never been here before, so I came with an open mind. I am ecstatic. One of the real values of getting to work on these films is that you get to travel across the globe and interact with people from different cultures. I am a big fan of telling my children that their job in life is to collect as many fascinating experiences as they can. Part of that is travelling, cultural experiences, understanding the world and becoming a

global citizen. It’s really meaningful for me to get my family here.


Are you familiar with Indian cinema?
I have seen a few Indian films like Dabangg. I think Indian audiences will love the fact that Robot/Enthiran (S Shankar’s 2010 bilingual starring Rajinikanth) was almost a big influence on Avengers: Age of Ultron, 2015 (directed by Joss Whedon). There is a sequence in Robot, where all the robots come together to form a giant snake. In the Avengers movie, there was a bunch of Ultrons, who come together to form a giant Ultron. The scene was eventually cut for time, but that was a direct influence from Robot.

You have made four Marvel films in the past six years. What do you think is integral to the future of superhero films?
The more diverse they get, the more interesting they become. Everyone has a right to see themselves on screen. Audiences become more passionate, when storytellers get more inclusive. The next phase of Marvel movies will get more diverse. Look at the success of Black Panther and Captain Marvel. The new crop of stories will have more pure global influence.


During an interview Tom Hanks told us that because of the rich technology and CGI, superhero films are living up to the promise of comic books. But eventually, the tide will turn. The stories that always remain with you are the ones showing human condition.
These (superhero films) are human stories! They are highly relatable characters. Listen, I think that if it’s not your cup of tea, you tend to shutout. For a whole global generation of film goers, these movies have become very important. They are a part of their growing up years and pop culture. The best of these movies tell compelling stories about humans, who happen to have powers. The powers are secondary to the experiences of characters as people and the choices that they make. I think the best of these movies have incredible thematics in them. I don’t necessarily think you can call superhero films a fad, when it has this kind of global reach. I think you just have to respect the fact the audience finds a lot in these films to inspire and connect them.

Speaking of #Whateverittakes (the punchline of Endgame), what does it take for you and Anthony (the other Russo brother co-directing the film) to work with so many superstars on one film?
It takes a lot (smiles!). It’s been a great experience for us. We have been very fortunate that this cast is incredible. Look, Oscar winners show up just to do one day’s work for your film, so you are spoilt as a filmmaker with the love of your cast.

You hear things like Robert Downey Jr wanting multiple vanity vans. He even jokes about it. He seems like a diva. Is he like that for real?
He jokes about it (laughs!), but you know why he does that? I think it is to play along and create a persona. He acts like a diva, but he is actually the hardest working actor you will ever work with. He is exceedingly professional. There is a reason why he is one of the biggest movie stars in the world. The energy and effort he puts into his work every second and the way he approaches his character and believes what it is, the way he shows up on set everyday, the level of intensity he brings to his work ethic — it’s commendable. Even when he promotes his films... that requires a lot of effort. He has a certain effervescence about him that’s universally translated and it comes at a cost. It requires him to project himself a certain way.

Tony Stark feels like RDJ’s alter ego, Chris Hemsworth exudes Thor’s confidence in his physical strength... it’s amazing how these characters seem like they are based on the actors that play them.
It’s interchangeable, isn’t it? You want the actors to have an emotional connect with the characters they play. When you really get to know Robert, you discover that he is nothing like Tony Stark. He has a public persona that he slips into, which is like Tony but when you have an intimate conversation with him, you realise he is very different. He is warm, genuine and generous human being. Chris Evans relates to one of the important people from his childhood. He based Captain America’s performance on this man he knew, so that’s very personal. They all find a certain sense of themselves in these characters after playing them for so long.

Is this Chris Evans’ last film as Captain America? He had hinted about it.
Chris Evans said this is his last film? I don’t know what he has been drinking (smiles). Impossible to say, anything can happen. This is the Marvel Universe. I won’t give away the plot, except that Infinity War was told from the point of view of Thanos and this one is not.

It was heartbreaking to see Loki being killed in Infinity War.
A lot of people are upset about that but all good things come to an end.

Speaking of fiercely guarding the plot, is it true that Tom Holland doesn’t get the script because he can’t keep secrets?
Yes, he doesn’t (smiles). He just gets his lines and that’s it. He is not even told who he is acting opposite of. We use vague terms to describe to him what’s happening. He has a difficult time keeping his mouth shut (laughs).



The legendary Stan Lee is no longer with us. It won’t be the same without him, isn’t it?
I wouldn’t be where I am today if it wasn’t for Stan Lee. I grew up on his comic books since I was 10, he is my idol. I believe that his final cameo is in this film. To get an opportunity to not only work on the material that he created, but to be able to work with him was a dream come true.

What are the pros and cons of co-directing with your brother Anthony, being part of a joint venture?
The pros are the fact that we have been able to make four Marvel movies in the last six years without dropping dead. There are no cons. Of course there are conflicts. We are always arguing and that makes this process successful. We challenge every idea that comes to the table and the best idea wins. It’s about maintaining the right balance between pushing against each other and backing off. Out of that comes a chemistry that creates these movies.

The superheroes abstain from sex. There was an interesting article on this that recently went viral.
No sex in Avengers movies? There was a bedroom scene in Infinity War, which implied that. But I think it is about the demographics. These movies need to translate with the children as well as they do gravitate towards these movies. The whole family should be able to enjoy these films without having to put hands on their children’s eyes. At the core, the characters are human and their psychology has been the focus more than their sexuality I guess.

What’s next for you in the MCU?

Eleven years of storytelling, nine franchises and 22 movies culminate into this film. Now, I want to take a little break. We have made four films in six years. You need to find the right stories to be able to reach the audience on this scale. It has been an enriching experience for us.


Endgame is the longest Marvel film till date?

It’s 3 hours and 2 minutes. It’s 11 years of narrative culminating into one movie. We are focusing on the original six avengers and closing the book on those characters so a lot of thought went into creating a powerful ending. We just couldn’t get the duration down. It’s a lot of storytelling with lot of characters. No one has ever done even remotely anything like this. A lot of characters in Infinity War are staggering. It requires a lot of disciple and focus to create moments that validate the existence of those characters in that story. Endgame is wrapping up all of this so we knew it will never be under three hours.


While DC has had an inconsistent run at the box office. Marvel keeps churning blockbusters time and again. What is the secret?

Marvel does this amazing job of picking people who care about these films and find immense joy in making them. Be it James Gunn, Ryan Coogler or my brother and myself. I have been collecting comic books since I was 10 years old. Being comic book geeks means you understand the methodology behind the characters. You understand the archetype and values they represent. The audience values the subtleties you bring to the table."

Love blossomed between the two after the show wrapped up last year. While everything was seemingly fine between them, it was recently reported that Prateek has moved on and is now dating Reyhna Pandit, who plays the antagonist on 'Manmohini', which he was directing till some time ago. Many feel that his relationship with Donal went kaput because of Reyhna’s proximity to the director.

A source close to Prateek and Donal shared, “They have taken time off from their relationship. It was a mutual decision taken a couple of months ago. Whether they get back together or not, only time will tell.”


Denying any truth to the rumours of him dating Reyhna, Prateek told us, “Whatever is between Donal and me, should remain between us. Whether we are together or not is entirely our call. What I can say for sure is that there is no third party involved in this situation. No one has ever created a rift between us, and to set the record straight, I am not dating Reyhna.”

He added, “I get along with Reyhna and other team members of 'Manmohini', as we are all of the same age group. We had a lot of fun and enjoyed our time together during the shoot. I am friends with a lot of girls, and that doesn’t mean I am dating all of them. In fact, even Reyhna was aghast to hear these stories. The truth is, I have already moved on to the next project and hardly visit the set of 'Manmohini' these days. Just because I mingle well with people, it’s easy to link me with girls my age. A good friendship shouldn’t always be looked upon as an affair.”


On her part, Donal said, “I don’t want to talk about my personal life. I would like my work to be discussed, as I am completely focussed on it.” Despite repeated attempts, we couldn’t reach Reyhna for comment."

EC has nothing to say about the film’s release: EC counsel

A PIL was filed in the Bombay High Court against the film’s release, alleging that it violated the model code of conduct. The petitioner, Satish Sugriv Gaikwad, had sought a stay order on the release of the biopic. Following this, the Bombay HC issued a notice to the EC, asking for a response on the PIL. It had also asked the producers to submit their response. A division bench of Bombay high court comprising Chief Justice Naresh Patil and Justice NM Jamdar was hearing the PIL. Disposing the PIL, the HC bench said on Monday, “The Election Commission has already taken note of it and shall deal with it.”

Advocate Birendra Saraf, who presented the filmmakers and Vivek Oberoi in the film, told the court that a reply has already been filed to the EC.

But the release of the film during this period is not a violation of the model code of conduct, we have told this to the court. Whether the film will be released on April 5 or not, is the decision of the CBFC and not of the Election Commission. The Election Commission has nothing to say about the release of the film.”

The scheduled examination for film’s certification is today. Rajagopal told us, “Whether the film can release or not will be decided by the CBFC on the basis of the Cinematograph Act, and not because of model code of conduct violation, because it is not a violation.”

On Monday, after the HC dismissed the plea, the producer of the film, Sandip Ssingh, said in a statement, “We are very happy that finally the justice has been given to the film. We believe in the system and the law. We are hoping to release the film on time now.”

Why 26/11 film 'Hotel Mumbai' isn’t screening in India,"'Hotel Mumbai', which recreates the Taj siege, met its scheduled worldwide release last week – except in India. No explanation was forthcoming. We try to find one
Last Friday, those who were eagerly waiting to watch 'Hotel Mumbai' were surprised to see its shows suddenly go missing, even after the film’s worldwide release date was confirmed as March 29. Directed by Anthony Maras, and starring Anupam Kher, Dev Patel, Armie Hammer and Nazanin Boniadi, the film shows the experiences of the trapped hotel guests and staff as armed terrorists stormed the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel during the Mumbai terror attacks in 2008.
The film’s team is staying mum on why it skipped its originally-scheduled India release, and the silence has led many distributors to speculate that the reason could be its “sensitive content”, while other industry insiders suspect that with the post-Pulwama tensions and upcoming elections, it was bad timing. But turns out, the reason behind the silence is, in fact, a legal deadlock.
Separately, the film was pulled out of theatres in Australia and New Zealand after the mass shooting in Christchurch “out of respect for a country in mourning”, the film’s New Zealand distributor had said. But no official reason has been given for the film missing its India release.


We have no information: Hotel Mumbai’s team Anupam Kher, who plays Head Chef Hemant Oberoi in the film, had tweeted that the film would release “nationwide” on March 29. But he hasn’t tweeted anything about its India release since, and did not reply to our queries.
Jennifer Nguyen, publicist at Maxine Leonard PR, which is handling the marketing of the film, replied to an email query saying, “We do not have information to share at this time.”
Hotel Mumbai is a Bleecker Street and ShivHans Pictures film. ShivHans Pictures did not respond to our queries, and Bleecker Street (a New York-based film distribution company) told us they did not have the international rights for the film. Multiple production companies like Electric Pictures, Arclight Films, Thunder Road Pictures and Xeitgeist Entertainment Group are linked with the film. Gaurav Mishra, MD and producer at Xeitgeist Entertainment Group, an Australia and Singapore-based production company, declined to discuss the film’s India release date with a standard “No comments” reply. Electric Pictures and Arclight Films did not respond to our queries.
Till last week, BookMyShow displayed the release date of the film as “March 29”, but it was later changed to “December 27, 2019”. Asked if the release was actually deferred to that date, and if they were given any reason for it, a BookMyShow executive declined to comment by pointing out that only the producers of the film could answer queries related to the film’s release. The portal has now dropped the date from the desktop version of its website, which now only says “December”.



We don’t know why the film has not released: Indian exhibitors
Exhibitors say the last information they had about the film was its scheduled release date. However, the film’s team hasn’t contacted them since. Rajender Singh Jyala, Chief Programming Officer at Inox Leisure Limited, says, “We had information that the film was scheduled to release on March 29, but the distributors or the production house never got in touch with us for the release of the film on the date. So whether the film’s India release has been deferred or cancelled, we have no information.”
Tinku Singh, SRS Cinemas, adds, “There’s a suspicious silence surrounding the reasons the film has missed its India release date. We never heard about any studio tie-ups with this film or that any Indian distributor has bought the film. But this is not rare. Sometimes, foreign films will tie up with Indian studios or exhibitors for release, but that wasn’t the case this time.”

The film has sensitive content, who will take the risk?: Local distributors
The IMDB page of Hotel Mumbai lists all its distributors from several countries, but there’s no mention of India. Did the film not find any distributor in India? Shaaminder Mallik, a Delhi-based distributor, tells us, “The film was not released on the scheduled date because it couldn’t find any distributors in India. Indian distributors have their own apprehensions about a film which is also giving narrative space to terrorists.”
Another Delhi-based distributor, without wishing to be named, tells us, “We are not sure of the exact reasons the film didn’t release, but our information is that no distributors bought the film because of the sensitive nature of the content. There were reports that the film also attempts to humanise the terrorists. Should the film be released in India in the current scenario? With elections next month, we didn’t want to take the risk of protests and vandalism in theatres. It’s a foreign production, and none of the distributors found it a profitable venture to invest their money and take that risk. In case of opposition to the film, who will bear the losses?”

BookMyShow modified 'Hotel Mumbai’s release date from ‘29 March’ to ‘27 Dec’, but its desktop version later changed it to ‘Dec 2019’


Tussle over who gets to release film lands in Bombay High Court
A few days ago, it was reported that Plus Holdings, a Dubai-based company, took Netflix Global, Hotel Mumbai PTY LTD, Arclight Films and Xeitgeist Entertainment Group to the Bombay High Court over who had the rights to release the film in the SAARC region. Plus Holdings claimed that they had the original rights, which they had bought from Xeitgeist Entertainment Group, and moved the Bombay HC to stop Netflix from releasing the film. Netflix has since informed the court that its rights to show Hotel Mumbai on its platform have been terminated by Hotel Mumbai PTY Ltd (HMPL). They then sought to be deleted as a respondent party in the suit which was accepted by the HC. When contacted, Netflix declined to comment, saying that the matter was sub judice. Sources close to Netflix confirmed to DT that they will not be releasing the film in India, and they have nothing to do with the film now. But even though Netflix is no longer associated with the film, Plus Holdings cannot release the film yet, according to the court order.
Sandeep S Ladda, the lawyer representing Plus Holdings, told us their version of the case. We take you through the case step-by-step.
Over the dispute of distribution rights, Ladda filed a petition in the Bombay HC in February to stop Netflix from releasing the film in the SAARC territory. He claimed that Plus Holdings had bought the rights from Xeitgeist. The lawyer alleged that Xeitgeist then unlawfully transferred the movie’s rights to Netflix through a third party last year. However, it was revealed in court that “when the agreement was entered into between Plus Holdings and Xeitgeist, the SAARC distribution rights were held by Xeitgeist, but the agreement was later terminated and the distribution rights reverted to HMPL, the original owner of the film. Later, HMPL entered into an agreement with Netflix, which was also later terminated by HMPL.” Therefore, Xeitgeist contended that it was “powerless to stop HMPL or Netflix”.

Plus Holdings’ lawyer appealed to the Bombay HC to stop Netflix from releasing the film, saying that they had exclusive rights to release the film in the Indian subcontinent. Plus Holdings asked the court to restrain Netflix, Xeitgeist, HMPL and other associated parties that it listed in its petition from claiming any rights to the film in India till the time an ongoing dispute between itself and Xeitgeist is being adjudicated upon by a Singapore arbitration court. In a hearing on March 7, the Bombay High Court restrained HMPL from entering into any agreement related to the movie Hotel Mumbai. The matter has now been adjourned till April 4.

As Xeitgeist refused to comment, and Hotel Mumbai’s team didn’t respond to our queries, we are unable to bring you their version.


Will the film release in India?

The petition was filed to stop Netflix from releasing Hotel Mumbai. Since Netflix is no longer associated with the film, will it release in India now? Turns out, it is not that simple.

The March 7 order of the Bombay HC states, “In such a situation, whether Xeitgeist at all had any rights to be assigned in favour of HMPL and whether it can be said that Xeitgeist would be legitimately entitled to any rights of exhibitions of the film in question for the SAARC countries would be required to be considered.” Also, the court order states that HMPL, to whom the rights of the film for SAARC were reverted post contract-cancellation, did not appear in the court on March 7, and as stated above, even though HMPL holds all the rights to the film, it has been restrained from “entering into any agreement” regarding the film.

Sources close to the case say that Plus Holdings will continue to seek to block the release of the movie in India through any other channel as it holds exclusive broadcasting and other rights. Ladda confirmed to us, “My client is ready and willing to exercise their rights to distribute the film in India as well in other countries as per contract.” However, he refused to respond if Plus Holdings is in talks with any Indian exhibitor or distributor for the release of the film.

Amid the legal wrangling, it looks like India won’t get to watch a film on one of the most infamous terror attacks on its soil anytime soon, while it puts the spotlight on the attacks internationally."

She felt that her original surname — Gupta — brought caste consciousness and hence, decided to drop it. The actress has now started using her late grandfather’s name, Ayodhya, as a tribute to him. Sonyaa says, “I feel that surname gives away not just your caste, but also your standing in the social order. Sometimes, it reflects a person’s economic status as well. I find it absurd. I don’t believe in anything that discriminates humans, be it religion or caste. I strongly feel that surname should not be used as a benchmark to check whether someone is superior or not. That’s why I decided to drop my surname.”


Since the last name is mandatory on social networking profiles, Sonyaa randomly entered Pink as her surname. This created a lot of confusion. “I added Pink on an impulse, but it resulted in a lot of confusion with people actually taking it as my surname,” she says, adding, “I never got to meet my grandparents and I don’t know much about them. So, as a tribute to my grandfather, I started using his name as my last name. It makes me feel connected to my roots. Now, I am Sonyaa Ayodhya.”"

Getting a chiseled core is not easy — it requires dedication and determination. Having said that, remember that every person is different, so what may work for someone else, may not for you, and vice versa. Here are five ab exercises that will help your achieve a strong core.
Partial sit up
Start by lying on your back and bending your knees. Keeping your arms straight, slowly raise them overhead and start to sit up halfway. Hold on for three seconds and return back to the original position. Repeat this at least 10 times.


Swiss ball crunch This may seem easy but is harder than it looks. Take a medium sized Swiss ball and lie back on the ball with your feet on the floor about shoulder-width apart. Make sure that your lower back is well supported. Now, place your hands at the back of your head, start to curl your body while slowly getting off the ball till you’re sitting up. Repeat this eight to 10 times.

Leg raises

Lie down in front of a pole or a heavy piece of furniture. Hold the the pole just above your head and keep your legs straight. Now, lift them up until they’re completely vertical and slowly lower them back. Make sure you don’t touch your legs to the floor but bring them down just inches above it. Repeat this 10 to 12 times.


Side/ star plank

Bored doing the regular planks? Try the side plank, which is twice as challenging. Start by lying down on your right side and place your right forearm on the floor. Slowly raise your hips, keeping your shoulder, hips and ankles in a straight line, pulling your stomach in. Make sure that your right forearm and right foot are bearing your weight. Hold on for as long as you can and repeat on the other side.

Another effective plank exercise is the star plank where you need to get into a push-up position. Next, place your arms and legs are far apart as possible, so that your body looks like a star. Make sure your palms are flat on the floor and your weight is equally distributed. Hold on for 15 to 20 seconds and repeat twice.


Swiss Ball Plank Circle

Take a Swiss ball and place it on the floor. Place your hands on it as if you’re getting into a push-up with your legs in a straight line behind you. Slowly lower your forearms while they are firmly placed on the ball, keeping yourself straight. Use your elbows and wrists to move the ball in a circular motion, both clockwise and counterclockwise. This exercise requires control so that you don’t lose your balance."

The actress, who went on a maternity break in September 2017, has not yet decided whether she will return to the show that made her a household name.

However, the makers of the show are in no mood to wait longer. Producer Asit Kumarr Modi told BT, “I will have to start looking for a new Dayaben. No one is bigger than the show. Taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah will go on with a new face, because the family is incomplete without Dayaben.”


Modi also added how his team has waited enough for Disha. He said, “So many working women in the country get pregnant, go on a maternity break, have babies and resume their jobs. Today, women continue to work even after having babies. We have given Disha leave, but we cannot wait forever. Having said that, replacing an actress is not an overnight process. The track has to be planned months in advance. Right now, we have started the initial process of auditioning for the character. We are still not sure what will happen in the future, but I would like to reiterate that the show must go on.”"

Dipen Mitra, the proprietor of Mitra cinema — an iconic theatre in north Kolkata — turned up in crisp white dhoti-kurta and wore a smile to greet a motley group of movie lovers. He offered a platter of korapaaker sandesh and said it would be a huge loss for those who didn’t savour them. He showed rare pictures of old Kolkata and reminisced the golden era of Bengali cinema. Though he didn’t speak of his decision to close the theatre that day, he did say he was concerned about what would happen to it after he’s gone. The theatre, which was earlier known as Chitra cinema, changed hands and began its journey as Mitra in 1963. After decades of running movies of Satyajit Ray, Mrinal Sen, Ritwik Ghatak and many contemporaries, it downed shutters at the beginning of the month. With it, more single screens seem to be staring at a bleak future. In a brief chat, Dipen Mitra talks about his decision that has proved how April is indeed the cruellest month. Excerpts:
What made you decide to down shutters?

As we speak, I’m sitting at a hospital for a check-up. I’ve been ailing for quite some time now and didn’t want to pass my burden onto others. When people ask me, ‘How are you doing Dipenda?’, I tell them, ‘First class!’ But I’ve developed quite a few problems. I invested `20 lakh recently to renovate the theatre, but health issues started cropping up one after the other.
What about your family?

I asked my sister-in-law about the problem. She too isn’t keeping well and can’t walk much. Then I asked my nephew if he would take responsibility of the theatre. My mother didn’t get me married. I had told her many times that fix a match for me, but that never happened (laughs). But she left me without foreseeing this future. Jokes apart, I asked my nephew, who is a chartered accountant and lives in Gurgaon. He has a demanding job and he clearly told me neither could he shift here nor did the family business interest him. He said he would ask a legal firm to look into the matter. What I realised after talking to them was that my employees would incur great losses if they took charge. I called my employees and asked them, ‘Tora ki korbi bol?’ They said they were ready to sign legal papers should I ask them to. I spoke to the lawyers and drafted an MoU. I summoned an employee and asked him to read it out to the rest. ‘Tui toh porashona korechhish, pore shona,’ I told him. He said if I’d read it, they had no problems with it. They left the papers on my table. I’ve cleared all their dues. They said, ‘Sir, apni ki korben?’ They are worried about me. Frankly, if anyone wants to run this theatre, I’d be more than happy.

What do you plan to do with the theatre?

As of now, I don’t know. My nephew has asked me to sell it off. I am 75. At this age, I’m not getting married and I don’t need to worry about my wife or kids! My brother passed away at an early age. All I have is my sister-in-law, nephew and his family.

Will you from now on lead a retired life?

I was never into any service, so there’s no question of retirement. I have nothing to gain or lose. About what I’ll do in future, only time will tell. See, my idea was never to close this theatre. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have spent a huge amount on changing the transformer and upgrading the sound system. Only this morning, the air-conditioner maintenance person turned up at my door. Till I’m alive, I’ll keep maintaining the building. I am worried about my employees.

What was the last running film?

Kesari. A lot of people are writing on social media that Mitra is turning into a mall, but fact is, I haven’t sold the theatre yet. These days, rumours spread very fast. Someone asked me why I was going to a hospital in the morning and said he would fix up an appointment with a cardiac surgeon. I said I don’t have a heart problem. I don’t know why people can’t let others be!

Film frat mourns the closing of iconic theatre

‘Single screens are losing out to plexes in Kolkata’

Dipenda’s character is akin to the one I showed in Cinemawala. I, in fact, used his trophies in the film. I share a long association with him. When my first film, Waarish, released, he had come for its private screening at a south Kolkata theatre. He was so moved that he blessed me for the film. I’ve been to his theatre for many films. Nagarkirtan was running there recently and I visited the theatre after Drishtikone’s release last year. Every time I went there, he would treat me to cutlets. Fact is, single screens are losing out to plexes in Kolkata. They can’t give the wholesome experiences that plexes can now give — there’s no window-shopping involved and it doesn’t give you the false feeling of a Singapore trip. It’s very sad for Bengali cinema and I just hope the theatre reopens soon.
— Kaushik Ganguly, filmmaker

‘There’s no charity involved in the business of cinema’

Last year went well for Mitra. I know that as I visited the theatre after the release of Uma and Ek Je Chhilo Raja. Dipenda treated me to sweets and said those were available only in north Kolkata. About this year, I’m not too sure. He is a khandaani businessman and this news came as a big blow. At a time when a plot of land in Kolkata comes at a premium, it may be commercially more viable to exploit a big property. There’s no charity involved in the business of cinema. I’m only
hoping that if a multi-storeyed building comes up in its place, there should be one floor to screen films.
— Srijit Mukherji, filmmaker

‘This is a huge blow for Bengali cinema’

I share an old association with Dipenda. The first time I got involved with distribution was when Rituparno Ghosh made Unishe April. I knew the film could not be accommodated in Mitra and the team was heartbroken. Some of my films like Sudhu Tumi and Cross Connection have run there. I’d often visit the place and tell Dipenda, ‘Get married now.’ It’s such a theatre where Mon Janena can run, much like Cross Connection or Haami. So, it’s a mixed audience. For me, it’d be a reality check every time I went there. Dipenda doesn’t mince words and he’d tell me where a film stood. This is a huge blow for Bengali cinema.

— Sudeshna Roy, filmmaker


‘I don’t know what is the reason behind this’

It’s a big loss for the film industry. I don’t know what is the reason behind this. As a single theatre, Mitra holds an important place in Kolkata. It also has an audience. I am hoping the authorities will have a dialogue and work towards resolving this deadlock.

83,"Apr 3, 2019, 04:00 IST","TNN / Apr 3, 2019, 04:00 IST",Hollywood,Meet Bengaluru's acid attack survivor who is an inspiration to many,"In 2006, a beautiful 23-year-old Pragya Prasun was subjected to her worst nightmare. Barely 10 days after she got married, a jilted lover threw acid on her face. Ever since, her life has been about accepting the truth and trying to move ahead. Now, 35-year-old Pragya, who recently won the Nari Shakti Puraskar — the highest civilian award given to women in India — talks to us about her journey from a meek and conflicted acid attack victim to a survivor and a beacon of hope for many.
‘My foundation was born out of my greatest sorrow’
Her struggle with burns and rehabilitation made Pragya rethink her life goals. “I was lucky to be from an educated and a financially-stable family, who asked the right questions. But while I was undergoing treatment in hospital, I saw a lot of burn victims, who were losing hope, as there was no one to guide them. So, I decided to help them. I started guiding them to the right doctor and giving them information about their diet and the treatments for scars,” she says. In a bid to help burn victims ask the right question and seek help at the right places, Pragya started an NGO, which has rehabilitated more than 200 acid attack victims across the country. From guiding patients to conducting burn camps, where nearly 25 surgeries for burns patients across the country are done in 3-4 days, her foundation (started in 2013) has come a long way. “Other than that, we get surgeries done for the patients one by one or in a group of 2-3 patients throughout the year in Bengaluru, Chennai, Delhi and Mumbai. The surgery count goes up till 3-4 each month. For four years, we have also been getting laser treatment and hair transplant done for 1-2 patients every month,” she adds.

‘I tried to push my husband away’
With 47% burns and hypertrophic scars all over, it was anything but easy going for Pragya after the attack. “I was a newly-married woman and barely 12 days into my marital life when I was attacked. To look at myself like that in the mirror impacted me deeply. I thought that my marriage would not sustain, as the first three years were difficult. I felt guilty about messing up my husband’s life and I tried to push him away. But he has been very supportive and has taken good care of me,” says Pragya. “I had suffered two miscarriages and was not in a good mind space, but after my first daughter was born in 2009, my life changed. She was the positivity in my life,” she says.

‘It is definitely not easy for my daughter’

But even with a positive family, all has not been rosy for Pragya or her two daughters, as society has been harsh on them. “It used to be extremely difficult to just take my daughters to the playground or drop them at school, as parents would look away from us and even pull their children away. At school, my daughters are asked, ‘Why does your mother look like a ghost?’ But both my daughters are now strong and have developed coping skills,”

says Pragya, who feels that society is yet to become more accepting of acid attack victims.


‘Hope Chappak makes people more accepting of acid attack survivors’

This is why Pragya hopes that Deepika Padukone’s film with Meghna Gulzar, titled Chappak, is a changemaker. Chappak is based on an acid attack survivor. “I am glad that Deepika and a seasoned director like Meghna Gulzar have picked the issue of acid attacks as a subject for their film. I was amazed to see the first look. At the same time, I lament that the makeup Deepika wore for the movie is an everyday reality for many like me. I

sincerely hope that the way people accept her in the movie is how they accept real-life survivors. I hope that the awareness this creates highlights the menace of acid attack in the society and is, therefore, eradicated from our world forever.”"

When it didn’t happen, one of them flung a beer mug at me,” Akshay recalls, adding that he is set to file a complaint against the offender. “This was a night that came with a prior warning. It was called Undressed Comedy and the guests knew that there would be some sexually explicit jokes. Through the course of the night, there were some jokes that centred on pedophilia,” explains Akshay.

Akshay adds. “I guess the jokes got the better of them and since I was the last act, they tried to ask for some kind of an apology, but seeing none coming, the mug was hurled at me in frustration.”

The incident was shared by Akshay on his Facebook page, which was how many other comics heard of it and then condemned the act. Sanjay Manaktala points out, “It is not uncommon for someone to take offence to jokes. But the best feedback in comedy is laughter and these guys could have kept quiet. Inciting violence is definitely not right. And the people who are being accused here are definitely not uneducated. I have seen a similar incident once. I was waiting for my turn for a show in Singapore, where there was another person on stage before me. He was making fun of Australians and their drinking habits, when one of the members took offence and threw a beer bottle. The audience member, luckily for me, was taken out before I went on stage. But at such shows, it is hard to know when someone is offended and how they would react.”

Danish Sait, too, adds that this incident is unacceptable. “People need to stop being righteous. When they have gone to a night that has stand-up comedy, they understand that comedy is a heightened state of a regular situation. If one doesn’t agree to the jokes, the best is to get up and leave. Just because one has paid, no one will dance to your tunes. A comic usually prepares a set of jokes that he likes. Hecklers, who are just trolls from the online world in real life, are always around,” he adds.

But how does one learn to handle these hecklers? “It takes a lot of practice. I have seen a lot of senior comics like Sorabh Pant go from ignoring to addressing them to now just asking them to shut up and not ruin the show,” says Danish. Sanjay adds, “Another thing most comics end up doing is building their own network. All of us have friends in the legal sector and other corporate bodies.”"

We spoke to Gourov Dasgupta, who was in Bengaluru recently, about his love for the city, indie artistes and more. Excerpts:
Bengaluru’s music scene has changed over the years
When I used to live in Bengaluru, rock music was at its best. I had come down to the city to watch Iron Maiden perform live. A lot has changed now, though. But that’s the case everywhere. DJs have taken over and people like chill-out music and proper musicians have slowly ventured in to the film industry or are composing for advertisements, because there’s no other way to survive. I have performed at several music

festivals in Bengaluru, and that’s when one could experience the city’s love for music.

Working on remixes is a challenge

Gourov, who recently tasted success with Total Dhamaal, says that remixing a classic requires a lot of work. “It’s extremely challenging because, no matter how hard you work, a certain section will always criticise you and compare it with the original, whereas some will be happy with it. Honestly, as musicians, we would not want to do recreations. I think that’s a global sentiment. But recreations seem to be working because, every record label and every producer wants them. There is something that seems to be clicking with the audience. Probably, the younger generation hasn’t heard the original version and they are enjoying the rehashed version,” says Gourov, adding that, as composers, they try to add their style to any recreation they work on. “Everyone wants to work on original compositions but, sometimes we don’t have a choice. If a record label says that they want this particular thing, one has to do it or else someone else will do it,” says Gourov. But doesn’t that curtail the freedom of a music composer? “It does. But you need to be in a position to decide a lot of things. Thankfully, we are able to strike a balance,” adds Gourov.


Indie artists are getting more exposure today

Unlike earlier, indie artistes today are performing several gigs, says Gourov. “Things are getting better for indie artistes. There are many pop rock bands and other indie acts that are doing well today, but rock music in particular, I’m not sure of. There are so many of them performing at big venues,” he sums up."

With different exercising techniques and diets, college students are fitter than ever and leave no stone unturned to look and feel their best.
Hitting the gym and indulging in sporting activities
For many city students, hitting the gym on a daily basis is a must and this is due to various reasons. “I go to the gym daily and spend at least two hours in there. I was into sports when I was in school and once I came to college, I didn’t want to lose touch with my physical activities. So, I began hitting the gym. In addition to this, I run as well,” says Tarun Kumar, a student of Presidency University. Students don’t just hit the gym, but do exercises depending on their strengths and their goals. “I like to lift weights. I was doing functional training, but realised that I couldn’t do a handstand. I was also losing a lot of weight because I wasn’t eating right. That’s when I stopped functional training and started lifting weights and saw the difference,” says Greeshma Ramesh, a student of St. Joseph’s College of Commerce, who hits the gym six days a week. Today, students love to experiment with different exercising techniques. “I indulge in different forms of workouts like power yoga, aerobics, Tabata and more,” says Preksha Vijay, a student of Nitte Meenakshi Institute of Technology.


Diet plays a crucial role

If you exercise regularly, but don’t follow a diet, it doesn’t serve the purpose, say students, which is why they too follow a strict diet based on their exercise routine. “Diet is a very important aspect of one’s fitness regime. For example, other than hitting the gym, I follow intermittent fasting with a keto diet. Keto requires you to replace carbs with fat. Intermittent fasting is where one fasts for 16 hours and consumes meals in the eight hour window,” says Preksha.

But following a diet is not easy and cheat days too are done keeping in mind the repercussions. “People say that most of your fitness regime is mostly 30% workout and 70% diet. So yes, diet is important, especially when you’re building muscles. I consume calorie-surplus food and make sure that I consume a particular amount of calories every day,” says Tarun, adding that chicken, eggs and other natural proteins are included in his diet on a daily basis. “Following a diet is hard because calories matter and it’s not easy. Even when I have a cheat day, it has to be calories-based. I cannot go overboard. My diet is specific; I consume brown rice, brown bread and chicken breast, in addition to other things,” says Greeshma.


Exercising doesn’t come cheap

Gym subscriptions and following diets are a costly affair and students spend anywhere between `7,000 to `10,000 a month for this. “Along with training fees, protein shakes and supplements, my every month expenditure on my fitness routine is approximately `7,000,” says Preksha. Similarly, Greeshma says that since she follows a strict diet, it does cost her a lot every month. “Since protein powders are expensive, the overall cost of my fitness regime automatically goes up. Since I like having chicken and eggs every day, my per month expenses are anywhere between `5,000 and 7,000,” Greeshma sums up."

We spoke to Gourov Dasgupta, who was in Bengaluru recently, about his love for the city, indie artistes and more. Excerpts:
Bengaluru’s music scene has changed over the years
When I used to live in Bengaluru, rock music was at its best. I had come down to the city to watch Iron Maiden perform live. A lot has changed now, though. But that’s the case everywhere. DJs have taken over and people like chill-out music and proper musicians have slowly ventured in to the film industry or are composing for advertisements, because there’s no other way to survive. I have performed at several music

festivals in Bengaluru, and that’s when one could experience the city’s love for music.

Working on remixes is a challenge

Gourov, who recently tasted success with Total Dhamaal, says that remixing a classic requires a lot of work. “It’s extremely challenging because, no matter how hard you work, a certain section will always criticise you and compare it with the original, whereas some will be happy with it. Honestly, as musicians, we would not want to do recreations. I think that’s a global sentiment. But recreations seem to be working because, every record label and every producer wants them. There is something that seems to be clicking with the audience. Probably, the younger generation hasn’t heard the original version and they are enjoying the rehashed version,” says Gourov, adding that, as composers, they try to add their style to any recreation they work on. “Everyone wants to work on original compositions but, sometimes we don’t have a choice. If a record label says that they want this particular thing, one has to do it or else someone else will do it,” says Gourov. But doesn’t that curtail the freedom of a music composer? “It does. But you need to be in a position to decide a lot of things. Thankfully, we are able to strike a balance,” adds Gourov.


Indie artists are getting more exposure today

Unlike earlier, indie artistes today are performing several gigs, says Gourov. “Things are getting better for indie artistes. There are many pop rock bands and other indie acts that are doing well today, but rock music in particular, I’m not sure of. There are so many of them performing at big venues,” he sums up."

The actress, who was part of the film 'Mulk' which was shot extensively in Lucknow, says that Lucknow somehow brings out her artistic personality. ""I shot for 'Mulk' which was for around 21 days and starting from having nawabi cuisines on set to chikan shopping, everything was just amazing, I really enjoyed myself. I feel that Lucknow actually brings out the artist in me. Of course, my journey started with Lucknow and Jaipur where I used to come and do stage shows. I feel that somewhere, Lucknow se mera pichhle janm ka naata hai. It has a great vibe and I love wearing chikan suits. I think, given a choice for 365 days I can wear chikan suits and saris. I am not a jeans and a western attire person, so I am happy wearing a chikan kurta and sharara which I think suits me the best. I love the whole feel of the place."" The kathak danseuse and actress who recently lost her guru Ganesh Hiralal ji, of the seventh generation of the Hiralal family of the Jaipur gharana, feels that she has not just lost her guru but someone who taught her to live through dance. Talking about it and getting emotional at the same time, Prachee says, ""The emotions are coming out in bouts because this morning when I woke up I had no one to talk to. He was 82 and for two years he had congestion in his chest. Who would have thought that one day I would wake up and not find him around me. He was someone who was more of a father figure rather than a guru.""

Prachee with her guru late Ganesh Hiralalji (BCCL/ Aditya Yadav)

She adds, ""I haven’t lost a guru, I have lost my soul! I have learnt kathak for about 25 years and maine hamesha se one-on-one seekha hai. I have not attended any class so that bond was even more special. He was 82-years-old and one would not believe that he had performed on vocal padhanth with me till last year in all major festivals whether in India or abroad. So the thought that he is not around is still difficult for me to take in. My father and my husband were there during the funeral ceremony and they kept on sending me pictures, and I was crying continuously. I still can’t imagine that I have lost him because he is somebody who moulded me as a human being right from the way I project myself, the way I dress up and the way I talk. Unka hamesha se kehna tha ki ‘kaam bolna chahiye’, he never believed in outer appearances."" Adding, she says, ""The moment you are on stage whether it is for three hours or three minutes, it’s your entry that says it all. These were his words. The only strength I get while I am on stage is the fact that he is there with me on stage who can easily handle my flaws. And despite being a guru, he never overpowered me on stage. He said that ‘this is your stage, you make the laye, you make the rhythm, you conduct the show and I am there to guide you’. I mean which guru does that? I feel that I am thoroughly blessed to have him in his life. It’s been 25 years and all major festivals in the country or abroad, I have travelled everywhere with him and not once did he say ki ‘main thak gaya hoon ya mujhse nahi hoga’. He was the simplest man who was happy having daal, chawal, roti, sabzi and ice cream was his favourite dessert.""

Prachee Shah Paandya (BCCL/ Aditya Yadav)

""Now I really don’t know how will I be on stage, the fact that he will not be present to teach me and guide me is frightening. All these years he has seen me enter into the phase of a wife to a mother and been there when I was expecting my first child. The entire spiritual aspect in me is totally because of him because he was so spiritual,"" adds the actress who has also done films like Judwaa 2 and Student of The Year. The actress shares that the transition from television to film has been more difficult for her. Talking about her role in Mulk, Prachee says the film gave her a strong recognition in the film fraternity. ""I have been a part of television for more than 20 years so to kind of give you a breakthrough in films with a performance oriented role, I think Mulk has kind of started it for me. And now I can hope to do better films. I have done a complete commercial film like 'Judwaa 2' with David Dhawan ji, which sometimes amazes me ki I have done that film. I fall in such an age group where I neither look 45-50 years old nor 25-30. That is a reason I get to play the roles of mother and I believe playing a mother has a more wide range to it and a longer run career wise. So I am happy I got to do a film like Mulk which challenged me as an actor,"" says Prachee, who says she would love to experiment more with such roles.

It took me three years to protect it from Tom Holland and Mark Ruffalo, so I am not going to suddenly give it away,” jokes American filmmaker Joe Russo, of the Russo brothers, co-director of the year’s, perhaps, the decade’s most awaited superhero film — Avengers: Endgame, in a candid chat. This is his fourth Marvel film and the twenty-second film in the entirety of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). In Mumbai, to kick-start the film’s promotions, Joe spoke to Bombay Times on Indian influences in the Marvel series, his comic-book fixation, Stan Lee, Robert Downey Jr (RDJ) being nothing like Tony Stark, need for diversity, longevity of superhero films and more.
This is your first visit to India. Take us through your experience so far.
I have never been here before, so I came with an open mind. I am ecstatic. One of the real values of getting to work on these films is that you get to travel across the globe and interact with people from different cultures. I am a big fan of telling my children that their job in life is to collect as many fascinating experiences as they can. Part of that is travelling, cultural experiences, understanding the world and becoming a

global citizen. It’s really meaningful for me to get my family here.


Are you familiar with Indian cinema?
I have seen a few Indian films like Dabangg. I think Indian audiences will love the fact that Robot/Enthiran (S Shankar’s 2010 bilingual starring Rajinikanth) was almost a big influence on Avengers: Age of Ultron, 2015 (directed by Joss Whedon). There is a sequence in Robot, where all the robots come together to form a giant snake. In the Avengers movie, there was a bunch of Ultrons, who come together to form a giant Ultron. The scene was eventually cut for time, but that was a direct influence from Robot.

You have made four Marvel films in the past six years. What do you think is integral to the future of superhero films?
The more diverse they get, the more interesting they become. Everyone has a right to see themselves on screen. Audiences become more passionate, when storytellers get more inclusive. The next phase of Marvel movies will get more diverse. Look at the success of Black Panther and Captain Marvel. The new crop of stories will have more pure global influence.


During an interview Tom Hanks told us that because of the rich technology and CGI, superhero films are living up to the promise of comic books. But eventually, the tide will turn. The stories that always remain with you are the ones showing human condition.
These (superhero films) are human stories! They are highly relatable characters. Listen, I think that if it’s not your cup of tea, you tend to shutout. For a whole global generation of film goers, these movies have become very important. They are a part of their growing up years and pop culture. The best of these movies tell compelling stories about humans, who happen to have powers. The powers are secondary to the experiences of characters as people and the choices that they make. I think the best of these movies have incredible thematics in them. I don’t necessarily think you can call superhero films a fad, when it has this kind of global reach. I think you just have to respect the fact the audience finds a lot in these films to inspire and connect them.

Speaking of #Whateverittakes (the punchline of Endgame), what does it take for you and Anthony (the other Russo brother co-directing the film) to work with so many superstars on one film?
It takes a lot (smiles!). It’s been a great experience for us. We have been very fortunate that this cast is incredible. Look, Oscar winners show up just to do one day’s work for your film, so you are spoilt as a filmmaker with the love of your cast.

You hear things like Robert Downey Jr wanting multiple vanity vans. He even jokes about it. He seems like a diva. Is he like that for real?
He jokes about it (laughs!), but you know why he does that? I think it is to play along and create a persona. He acts like a diva, but he is actually the hardest working actor you will ever work with. He is exceedingly professional. There is a reason why he is one of the biggest movie stars in the world. The energy and effort he puts into his work every second and the way he approaches his character and believes what it is, the way he shows up on set everyday, the level of intensity he brings to his work ethic — it’s commendable. Even when he promotes his films... that requires a lot of effort. He has a certain effervescence about him that’s universally translated and it comes at a cost. It requires him to project himself a certain way.

Tony Stark feels like RDJ’s alter ego, Chris Hemsworth exudes Thor’s confidence in his physical strength... it’s amazing how these characters seem like they are based on the actors that play them.
It’s interchangeable, isn’t it? You want the actors to have an emotional connect with the characters they play. When you really get to know Robert, you discover that he is nothing like Tony Stark. He has a public persona that he slips into, which is like Tony but when you have an intimate conversation with him, you realise he is very different. He is warm, genuine and generous human being. Chris Evans relates to one of the important people from his childhood. He based Captain America’s performance on this man he knew, so that’s very personal. They all find a certain sense of themselves in these characters after playing them for so long.

Is this Chris Evans’ last film as Captain America? He had hinted about it.
Chris Evans said this is his last film? I don’t know what he has been drinking (smiles). Impossible to say, anything can happen. This is the Marvel Universe. I won’t give away the plot, except that Infinity War was told from the point of view of Thanos and this one is not.

It was heartbreaking to see Loki being killed in Infinity War.
A lot of people are upset about that but all good things come to an end.

Speaking of fiercely guarding the plot, is it true that Tom Holland doesn’t get the script because he can’t keep secrets?
Yes, he doesn’t (smiles). He just gets his lines and that’s it. He is not even told who he is acting opposite of. We use vague terms to describe to him what’s happening. He has a difficult time keeping his mouth shut (laughs).



The legendary Stan Lee is no longer with us. It won’t be the same without him, isn’t it?
I wouldn’t be where I am today if it wasn’t for Stan Lee. I grew up on his comic books since I was 10, he is my idol. I believe that his final cameo is in this film. To get an opportunity to not only work on the material that he created, but to be able to work with him was a dream come true.

What are the pros and cons of co-directing with your brother Anthony, being part of a joint venture?
The pros are the fact that we have been able to make four Marvel movies in the last six years without dropping dead. There are no cons. Of course there are conflicts. We are always arguing and that makes this process successful. We challenge every idea that comes to the table and the best idea wins. It’s about maintaining the right balance between pushing against each other and backing off. Out of that comes a chemistry that creates these movies.

The superheroes abstain from sex. There was an interesting article on this that recently went viral.
No sex in Avengers movies? There was a bedroom scene in Infinity War, which implied that. But I think it is about the demographics. These movies need to translate with the children as well as they do gravitate towards these movies. The whole family should be able to enjoy these films without having to put hands on their children’s eyes. At the core, the characters are human and their psychology has been the focus more than their sexuality I guess.

What’s next for you in the MCU?

Eleven years of storytelling, nine franchises and 22 movies culminate into this film. Now, I want to take a little break. We have made four films in six years. You need to find the right stories to be able to reach the audience on this scale. It has been an enriching experience for us.


Endgame is the longest Marvel film till date?

It’s 3 hours and 2 minutes. It’s 11 years of narrative culminating into one movie. We are focusing on the original six avengers and closing the book on those characters so a lot of thought went into creating a powerful ending. We just couldn’t get the duration down. It’s a lot of storytelling with lot of characters. No one has ever done even remotely anything like this. A lot of characters in Infinity War are staggering. It requires a lot of disciple and focus to create moments that validate the existence of those characters in that story. Endgame is wrapping up all of this so we knew it will never be under three hours.


While DC has had an inconsistent run at the box office. Marvel keeps churning blockbusters time and again. What is the secret?

Marvel does this amazing job of picking people who care about these films and find immense joy in making them. Be it James Gunn, Ryan Coogler or my brother and myself. I have been collecting comic books since I was 10 years old. Being comic book geeks means you understand the methodology behind the characters. You understand the archetype and values they represent. The audience values the subtleties you bring to the table."

Love blossomed between the two after the show wrapped up last year. While everything was seemingly fine between them, it was recently reported that Prateek has moved on and is now dating Reyhna Pandit, who plays the antagonist on 'Manmohini', which he was directing till some time ago. Many feel that his relationship with Donal went kaput because of Reyhna’s proximity to the director.

A source close to Prateek and Donal shared, “They have taken time off from their relationship. It was a mutual decision taken a couple of months ago. Whether they get back together or not, only time will tell.”


Denying any truth to the rumours of him dating Reyhna, Prateek told us, “Whatever is between Donal and me, should remain between us. Whether we are together or not is entirely our call. What I can say for sure is that there is no third party involved in this situation. No one has ever created a rift between us, and to set the record straight, I am not dating Reyhna.”

He added, “I get along with Reyhna and other team members of 'Manmohini', as we are all of the same age group. We had a lot of fun and enjoyed our time together during the shoot. I am friends with a lot of girls, and that doesn’t mean I am dating all of them. In fact, even Reyhna was aghast to hear these stories. The truth is, I have already moved on to the next project and hardly visit the set of 'Manmohini' these days. Just because I mingle well with people, it’s easy to link me with girls my age. A good friendship shouldn’t always be looked upon as an affair.”


On her part, Donal said, “I don’t want to talk about my personal life. I would like my work to be discussed, as I am completely focussed on it.” Despite repeated attempts, we couldn’t reach Reyhna for comment."

A PIL was filed in the Bombay High Court against the film’s release, alleging that it violated the model code of conduct. The petitioner, Satish Sugriv Gaikwad, had sought a stay order on the release of the biopic. Following this, the Bombay HC issued a notice to the EC, asking for a response on the PIL. It had also asked the producers to submit their response. A division bench of Bombay high court comprising Chief Justice Naresh Patil and Justice NM Jamdar was hearing the PIL. Disposing the PIL, the HC bench said on Monday, “The Election Commission has already taken note of it and shall deal with it.”

Why 26/11 film 'Hotel Mumbai' isn’t screening in India,"'Hotel Mumbai', which recreates the Taj siege, met its scheduled worldwide release last week – except in India. No explanation was forthcoming. We try to find one
Last Friday, those who were eagerly waiting to watch 'Hotel Mumbai' were surprised to see its shows suddenly go missing, even after the film’s worldwide release date was confirmed as March 29. Directed by Anthony Maras, and starring Anupam Kher, Dev Patel, Armie Hammer and Nazanin Boniadi, the film shows the experiences of the trapped hotel guests and staff as armed terrorists stormed the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel during the Mumbai terror attacks in 2008.
The film’s team is staying mum on why it skipped its originally-scheduled India release, and the silence has led many distributors to speculate that the reason could be its “sensitive content”, while other industry insiders suspect that with the post-Pulwama tensions and upcoming elections, it was bad timing. But turns out, the reason behind the silence is, in fact, a legal deadlock.
Separately, the film was pulled out of theatres in Australia and New Zealand after the mass shooting in Christchurch “out of respect for a country in mourning”, the film’s New Zealand distributor had said. But no official reason has been given for the film missing its India release.


We have no information: Hotel Mumbai’s team Anupam Kher, who plays Head Chef Hemant Oberoi in the film, had tweeted that the film would release “nationwide” on March 29. But he hasn’t tweeted anything about its India release since, and did not reply to our queries.
Jennifer Nguyen, publicist at Maxine Leonard PR, which is handling the marketing of the film, replied to an email query saying, “We do not have information to share at this time.”
Hotel Mumbai is a Bleecker Street and ShivHans Pictures film. ShivHans Pictures did not respond to our queries, and Bleecker Street (a New York-based film distribution company) told us they did not have the international rights for the film. Multiple production companies like Electric Pictures, Arclight Films, Thunder Road Pictures and Xeitgeist Entertainment Group are linked with the film. Gaurav Mishra, MD and producer at Xeitgeist Entertainment Group, an Australia and Singapore-based production company, declined to discuss the film’s India release date with a standard “No comments” reply. Electric Pictures and Arclight Films did not respond to our queries.
Till last week, BookMyShow displayed the release date of the film as “March 29”, but it was later changed to “December 27, 2019”. Asked if the release was actually deferred to that date, and if they were given any reason for it, a BookMyShow executive declined to comment by pointing out that only the producers of the film could answer queries related to the film’s release. The portal has now dropped the date from the desktop version of its website, which now only says “December”.



We don’t know why the film has not released: Indian exhibitors
Exhibitors say the last information they had about the film was its scheduled release date. However, the film’s team hasn’t contacted them since. Rajender Singh Jyala, Chief Programming Officer at Inox Leisure Limited, says, “We had information that the film was scheduled to release on March 29, but the distributors or the production house never got in touch with us for the release of the film on the date. So whether the film’s India release has been deferred or cancelled, we have no information.”
Tinku Singh, SRS Cinemas, adds, “There’s a suspicious silence surrounding the reasons the film has missed its India release date. We never heard about any studio tie-ups with this film or that any Indian distributor has bought the film. But this is not rare. Sometimes, foreign films will tie up with Indian studios or exhibitors for release, but that wasn’t the case this time.”

The film has sensitive content, who will take the risk?: Local distributors
The IMDB page of Hotel Mumbai lists all its distributors from several countries, but there’s no mention of India. Did the film not find any distributor in India? Shaaminder Mallik, a Delhi-based distributor, tells us, “The film was not released on the scheduled date because it couldn’t find any distributors in India. Indian distributors have their own apprehensions about a film which is also giving narrative space to terrorists.”
Another Delhi-based distributor, without wishing to be named, tells us, “We are not sure of the exact reasons the film didn’t release, but our information is that no distributors bought the film because of the sensitive nature of the content. There were reports that the film also attempts to humanise the terrorists. Should the film be released in India in the current scenario? With elections next month, we didn’t want to take the risk of protests and vandalism in theatres. It’s a foreign production, and none of the distributors found it a profitable venture to invest their money and take that risk. In case of opposition to the film, who will bear the losses?”

BookMyShow modified 'Hotel Mumbai’s release date from ‘29 March’ to ‘27 Dec’, but its desktop version later changed it to ‘Dec 2019’


Tussle over who gets to release film lands in Bombay High Court
A few days ago, it was reported that Plus Holdings, a Dubai-based company, took Netflix Global, Hotel Mumbai PTY LTD, Arclight Films and Xeitgeist Entertainment Group to the Bombay High Court over who had the rights to release the film in the SAARC region. Plus Holdings claimed that they had the original rights, which they had bought from Xeitgeist Entertainment Group, and moved the Bombay HC to stop Netflix from releasing the film. Netflix has since informed the court that its rights to show Hotel Mumbai on its platform have been terminated by Hotel Mumbai PTY Ltd (HMPL). They then sought to be deleted as a respondent party in the suit which was accepted by the HC. When contacted, Netflix declined to comment, saying that the matter was sub judice. Sources close to Netflix confirmed to DT that they will not be releasing the film in India, and they have nothing to do with the film now. But even though Netflix is no longer associated with the film, Plus Holdings cannot release the film yet, according to the court order.
Sandeep S Ladda, the lawyer representing Plus Holdings, told us their version of the case. We take you through the case step-by-step.
Over the dispute of distribution rights, Ladda filed a petition in the Bombay HC in February to stop Netflix from releasing the film in the SAARC territory. He claimed that Plus Holdings had bought the rights from Xeitgeist. The lawyer alleged that Xeitgeist then unlawfully transferred the movie’s rights to Netflix through a third party last year. However, it was revealed in court that “when the agreement was entered into between Plus Holdings and Xeitgeist, the SAARC distribution rights were held by Xeitgeist, but the agreement was later terminated and the distribution rights reverted to HMPL, the original owner of the film. Later, HMPL entered into an agreement with Netflix, which was also later terminated by HMPL.” Therefore, Xeitgeist contended that it was “powerless to stop HMPL or Netflix”.

Plus Holdings’ lawyer appealed to the Bombay HC to stop Netflix from releasing the film, saying that they had exclusive rights to release the film in the Indian subcontinent. Plus Holdings asked the court to restrain Netflix, Xeitgeist, HMPL and other associated parties that it listed in its petition from claiming any rights to the film in India till the time an ongoing dispute between itself and Xeitgeist is being adjudicated upon by a Singapore arbitration court. In a hearing on March 7, the Bombay High Court restrained HMPL from entering into any agreement related to the movie Hotel Mumbai. The matter has now been adjourned till April 4.

As Xeitgeist refused to comment, and Hotel Mumbai’s team didn’t respond to our queries, we are unable to bring you their version.


Will the film release in India?

The petition was filed to stop Netflix from releasing Hotel Mumbai. Since Netflix is no longer associated with the film, will it release in India now? Turns out, it is not that simple.

The March 7 order of the Bombay HC states, “In such a situation, whether Xeitgeist at all had any rights to be assigned in favour of HMPL and whether it can be said that Xeitgeist would be legitimately entitled to any rights of exhibitions of the film in question for the SAARC countries would be required to be considered.” Also, the court order states that HMPL, to whom the rights of the film for SAARC were reverted post contract-cancellation, did not appear in the court on March 7, and as stated above, even though HMPL holds all the rights to the film, it has been restrained from “entering into any agreement” regarding the film.

Sources close to the case say that Plus Holdings will continue to seek to block the release of the movie in India through any other channel as it holds exclusive broadcasting and other rights. Ladda confirmed to us, “My client is ready and willing to exercise their rights to distribute the film in India as well in other countries as per contract.” However, he refused to respond if Plus Holdings is in talks with any Indian exhibitor or distributor for the release of the film.

Amid the legal wrangling, it looks like India won’t get to watch a film on one of the most infamous terror attacks on its soil anytime soon, while it puts the spotlight on the attacks internationally."

She felt that her original surname — Gupta — brought caste consciousness and hence, decided to drop it. The actress has now started using her late grandfather’s name, Ayodhya, as a tribute to him. Sonyaa says, “I feel that surname gives away not just your caste, but also your standing in the social order. Sometimes, it reflects a person’s economic status as well. I find it absurd. I don’t believe in anything that discriminates humans, be it religion or caste. I strongly feel that surname should not be used as a benchmark to check whether someone is superior or not. That’s why I decided to drop my surname.”


Since the last name is mandatory on social networking profiles, Sonyaa randomly entered Pink as her surname. This created a lot of confusion. “I added Pink on an impulse, but it resulted in a lot of confusion with people actually taking it as my surname,” she says, adding, “I never got to meet my grandparents and I don’t know much about them. So, as a tribute to my grandfather, I started using his name as my last name. It makes me feel connected to my roots. Now, I am Sonyaa Ayodhya.”"

Getting a chiseled core is not easy — it requires dedication and determination. Having said that, remember that every person is different, so what may work for someone else, may not for you, and vice versa. Here are five ab exercises that will help your achieve a strong core.
Partial sit up
Start by lying on your back and bending your knees. Keeping your arms straight, slowly raise them overhead and start to sit up halfway. Hold on for three seconds and return back to the original position. Repeat this at least 10 times.


Swiss ball crunch This may seem easy but is harder than it looks. Take a medium sized Swiss ball and lie back on the ball with your feet on the floor about shoulder-width apart. Make sure that your lower back is well supported. Now, place your hands at the back of your head, start to curl your body while slowly getting off the ball till you’re sitting up. Repeat this eight to 10 times.

Leg raises

Lie down in front of a pole or a heavy piece of furniture. Hold the the pole just above your head and keep your legs straight. Now, lift them up until they’re completely vertical and slowly lower them back. Make sure you don’t touch your legs to the floor but bring them down just inches above it. Repeat this 10 to 12 times.


Side/ star plank

Bored doing the regular planks? Try the side plank, which is twice as challenging. Start by lying down on your right side and place your right forearm on the floor. Slowly raise your hips, keeping your shoulder, hips and ankles in a straight line, pulling your stomach in. Make sure that your right forearm and right foot are bearing your weight. Hold on for as long as you can and repeat on the other side.

Another effective plank exercise is the star plank where you need to get into a push-up position. Next, place your arms and legs are far apart as possible, so that your body looks like a star. Make sure your palms are flat on the floor and your weight is equally distributed. Hold on for 15 to 20 seconds and repeat twice.


Swiss Ball Plank Circle

Take a Swiss ball and place it on the floor. Place your hands on it as if you’re getting into a push-up with your legs in a straight line behind you. Slowly lower your forearms while they are firmly placed on the ball, keeping yourself straight. Use your elbows and wrists to move the ball in a circular motion, both clockwise and counterclockwise. This exercise requires control so that you don’t lose your balance."

When it didn’t happen, one of them flung a beer mug at me,” Akshay recalls, adding that he is set to file a complaint against the offender.
“This was a night that came with a prior warning. It was called Undressed Comedy and the guests knew that there would be some sexually explicit jokes. Through the course of the night, there were some jokes that centred on pedophilia,” explains Akshay.
Akshay adds. “I guess the jokes got the better of them and since I was the last act, they tried to ask for some kind of an apology, but seeing none coming, the mug was hurled at me in frustration.”
The incident was shared by Akshay on his Facebook page, which was how many other comics heard of it and then condemned the act. Sanjay Manaktala points out, “It is not uncommon for someone to take offence to jokes. But the best feedback in comedy is laughter and these guys could have kept quiet. Inciting violence is definitely not right. And the people who are being accused here are definitely not uneducated. I have seen a similar incident once. I was waiting for my turn for a show in Singapore, where there was another person on stage before me. He was making fun of Australians and their drinking habits, when one of the members took offence and threw a beer bottle. The audience member, luckily for me, was taken out before I went on stage. But at such shows, it is hard to know when someone is offended and how they would react.”
Danish Sait, too, adds that this incident is unacceptable. “People need to stop being righteous. When they have gone to a night that has stand-up comedy, they understand that comedy is a heightened state of a regular situation. If one doesn’t agree to the jokes, the best is to get up and leave. Just because one has paid, no one will dance to your tunes. A comic usually prepares a set of jokes that he likes. Hecklers, who are just trolls from the online world in real life, are always around,” he adds.
But how does one learn to handle these hecklers? “It takes a lot of practice. I have seen a lot of senior comics like Sorabh Pant go from ignoring to addressing them to now just asking them to shut up and not ruin the show,” says Danish. Sanjay adds, “Another thing most comics end up doing is building their own network. All of us have friends in the legal sector and other corporate bodies.”"

He will join top Silicon Valley venture capital (VC) firm Sequoia Capital’s India unit as managing director. The move is likely to be a booster for the startup ecosystem as Anandan will head an initiative launched by the VC firm to back very early stage startups both in India and Southeast Asia. Additionally, Anandan has been a prolific investor in early stage companies personally and is one of the early evangelists of the local internet market.
He will leave Google by the end of the month and is expected to join Sequoia Capital by the second half of the year, continuing to be based out of Delhi. His move comes after a rejig at Google’s operations in the region where Asia-Pacific head Karim Temsamani stepped down in December and was replaced by Greater China and Korea head Scott Beaumont in March.

Anandan’s exit will be a loss to Google as he scaled operations of the company to about $1.3 billion in revenues and was one of the biggest proponents of India’s digital story to the company’s brass. He had said that the next wave of internet consumption will be defined by three themes — voice, video and vernacular — that would catapult millions of new users to consume internet, launching new products targeted at these consumers. Voice queries and vernacular are expected to drive traffic as the number of Indian language users is expected to cross 500 million within two years.
Google India’s country director for sales Vikas Agnihotri will take over as the interim head, according to a statement. “Digital economy in India+SEA: $125B in 2018. 30%++ yoy (year on year) growth (revenues, not users). $500B addressable market by 2023. There simply has not been a better time to #startup in India and SEA!” 50-year-old Anandan tweeted about his move to Sequoia, where he will focused on leading its accelerator initiative Surge.

Sequoia had launched its Surge earlier this year where it plans to pick up 10–20 early stage startups twice every year and invest $1.5 million in each of them at the start of the programme. The new initiative, where Sequoia is likely to invest more than $100 million over the next four-five years, may also lead to the launch of a new fund, two sources had told TOI when the programme was launched. “Rajan’s deep understanding of technology, significant operating expertise and track record of growing tech businesses across the region will help Surge founders scale and build the transformational businesses of tomorrow,” said Sequoia in a statement.
A Sri Lankan Tamil, Anandan will join the other six MDs at Sequoia Capital India, three of whom are based in India and three in Singapore. Sequoia is considered the top VC firm in the US, being an early investor in iconic companies like Apple, Google, WhatsApp, YouTube and PayPal. Its portfolio companies in India include hotels to co-living venture Oyo and food-delivery startup Zomato, besides top companies in Southeast Asia like Indonesian ride-hailing giant Go Jek and online travel firm Traveloka.
His entry would also help the firm, which has raised $3.9 billion across six funds for the region, add firepower to its team as three of the MDs left to set up A91 Partners last year. VCs and entrepreneurs tracking the space said that the move underlines growing maturity for the startup ecosystem, where there are now experienced operators willing to take the plunge. Anandan’s move could set a precedent, they feel.
“His passion and commitment for the early stage ecosystem as an angel investor par excellence and his unique ability to connect with founders will inspire them to think bigger, move faster and be different,” said Ravi Gururaj, president of TiE Bangalore, adding that Anandan brings unique ability to scale up digital and technology revenues from India customers to billion-dollar levels.
A B.Sc in mechanical engineering from MIT with a masters from Stanford, Anandan started his career at McKinsey in the US where he spent over a decade and became partner on a fast track. He then moved to PC maker Dell where he served as executive assistant to founder Michael Dell and then moved to head the company’s business in India in 2006. In 2008, he joined Microsoft as India head and then moved to head Google operations as VP of India sales and operations. He was elevated to lead the Southeast Asia market as well in 2015."

One of the ‘make-or-break’ factors for organisations in a hyper-competitive and complex environment is the quality of their executive team — their top leadership. Unfortunately, this always has remained a neglected area. Partly getting the right talent, internally or externally, is a legitimate challenge. But even more importantly, the unwillingness to bite some bullets is another commonly observed pattern. And without this agenda being addressed, a lot of the strategic thinking and doing could fall between the cracks.

Get the best and keep the best: The war for the right executive talent is intense. People with the right skills and experience, combined with the appropriate softer skills of leadership, are not easy to find or attract. And yet, how do we ensure we follow the “two-pizza rule” for the size of the executive team and not make it an unwieldy exercise in appeasement? (According to the rule, generally attributed to Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, a team is too big if it cannot be fed with two pizzas). For boards and promoters, this must be an unending priority. The size, the mix, the constant struggle to look for and retain exemplary executive talent is a job not to be delegated or outsourced. Moreover, keeping top quality executives is never easy. They are not likely to be obedient and symbolic court poets. They will have a mind of their own and may even bruise a few egos, questioning some from the past. Whether individual ego will prevail over a larger organisational interest is a tough cookie to bite for many.
Ensuring the right dynamics: For chief executives, this must be the toughest challenge to meet after getting the executive talent in. Not everyone is able to forge the right team culture at the top. Creating a shared destiny within the team, encouraging constructive differences, not encouraging dysfunctional behaviours and being ‘true and fair’ with your top team is a CEO’s nightmare. It needs extraordinary wisdom and courage to forge a team of amazingly talented individuals at the top. How many CEOs are rewarded or penalised for something as strategically crucial? Barely any.

Performance & rewards dilemma: At this level, the stakes for rewards are high. Yet, collaboration to deliver a larger shared organisational goal is not axiomatic. Boards must ensure that overly individualistic rewards do not support integrative execution. There must be disproportionate share of the bonus purse for the executive team resting on shared goals. Or else you run the huge risk of siloed behaviour and independent satrapies, which do not support a sustainable organisation.
The ‘Prima Donna’ effect: Even executive teams espousing a commitment to ‘collective responsibility’ run the risk of dealing with overly high-strung individuals. Much of the “I am special” syndrome typically flows either from a perceived higher importance of their agenda or function, a long tenure in the company, or personal political alignment with the promoter or the board. This is obviously dangerous and must not be encouraged. However, in many situations, the obvious advice is observed more in the breach than in the observance. The inability or the unwillingness to rein in such errant behaviour of such strong men (or women) will lead to some other top talent opting to quit the team. The loss then is only the organisation’s.
Lack of inspiring role models: Many executive teams may have the requisite bouquet of functional leaders but lack inspiring role models. One of the biggest expectations of a top executive team is to inspire the larger company and beyond, attract and retain talent as also build a strong corporate brand. Not too many leaders at the top can claim to check these boxes off. In addition, a combination of functional experts is not a surrogate for an inspiring an executive team.
Each person in an organisation — from the doorman to the chairman — will have a view on whether the executive team of the company is indeed thriving or just unwilling to vacate space. The question is how dispassionately do we firm up our view. Still more crucially, how expeditiously do we make our decisions and interventions. The margin for error is barely there. And the clock is fast ticking away.

Directorate of education (DoE) has argued that schools are duty-bound to seek prior consent from it before any increase in fee, opposing the recent court decision allowing private unaided schools to go ahead with an interim hike in fee to implement the recommendations of the 7th Central Pay Commission on salaries of teachers and other employees.

In its plea, DoE has also questioned some of the findings of the single judge, claiming that several issues that have been decided were not even raised, such as land allotment liabilities. The appeal is likely to be heard on Wednesday.
The single judge on March 15 had permitted the interim fee hike by quashing a Delhi government circular of April 13 last year, which had prohibited private unaided schools functioning on government land from hiking tuition amount without approval from DoE.

HC, while setting aside the circular, had said the statements of fee submitted by private schools will be subject to scrutiny by DoE “with a view to ensuring that the schools were not indulging in commercialisation of education by resorting to profiteering, or charging of capitation fee.”
“The interim fee hike will operate immediately, in favour of all private unaided schools, without the requirement of any prior approval,” the court had said in its 173-page judgment allowing the plea of Action Committee Unaided Recognised Private Schools, which had challenged the circular.
The court had also made it clear that “if any school is, in fact, found to be indulging in commercialisation of education, DoE will be well within its rights in proceeding, against such institution, in accordance with law, and keeping in mind the provisions of Delhi Schools Education Act and Rules”.
The Action Committee, in its plea, had contended that Delhi Schools Education Act equalised all schools, in the matter of pay and allowances to be granted to teachers and employees and therefore, there was no justification to selectively withdraw the October 17, 2017 order which permitted an interim hike of fee to implement the 7th CPC recommendations.
In its order, DoE had barred schools in the national capital from hiking fees with retrospective effect to implement the 7th Central Pay Commission’s (CPC) recommendations. The schools questioned the reversal of stand, arguing that earlier permission by DoE was “unreasonably withdrawn with retrospective effect” by the April 13, 2018 circular and it showed the Delhi government was delaying implementation of the 7th pay commission’s recommendations in private unaided recognised schools for paying increased salaries and allowances to their teachers and other staff members."

The home ministry selected the best station on various parameters, including maintenance and cleanliness of the building, working out of heinous crimes, data uploaded on the network, workout percentage of cases and complaints of 2018, and disposal of inquiry reports of various complaints received from watchdogs.

Parameters like feedback about police conduct, maintenance of records and case property, and facilities available for visitors were also looked at while deciding the best station.
The police station has Wi-Fi, which can be accessed by visitors by registering their ID at the front desk. Apart from designated barracks, it has a fitness area for policemen. It also provides newspapers and legal literature in the visitors’ room. It boasts of a well-maintained register of medico-legal cases and statements of witnesses in calls, standing orders and circulars, as well as list of absconders and deserters.

It was closed on March 24 following a major fire incident.
Dr Rajesh Malhotra, chief of the centre, told TOI that the fire incident had caused significant damage to operation theatres (OTs) and equipment. “We have been working on war footing to make the OTs operational again,” he said.

The trauma centre has five OTs, of which three are likely to be made operational by the end of this week. Confirming this, Dr Malhotra said surgeries will also resume in full capacity once the OTs are made operational. On an average, 20 to 25 major surgeries take place at the trauma centre and about 200 patients visit the hospital’s emergency wing.
Following the fire incident, the hospital was not taking any emergency case over the past week. All patients were being referred to Safdarjung hospital or main campus of AIIMS, doctors said.

But describing the construction rates quoted in the Rs 4,700-crore plan as “inflated”, the Union human resource development ministry has junked the expansion and advised the university to seek funding through Higher Education Funding Agency (HEFA).

At a meeting of DU’s finance committee in February, the MHRD nominee, who is also a financial advisor in the ministry, objected to the rates quoted by the university’s Building Committee for the construction. Documents on four projects presented at the meeting, copies of which are with TOI, quoted Rs 70,000 per square metre as the construction cost, with the rate for the extension of Central Institute of Education being Rs 76,327 per sqm.
A source present at the meeting reported that the HRD nominee said the correct rate should be in the range of Rs 35,000-45,000 per sqm. “Even in north-east Delhi, where the cost of construction is higher, it is around Rs 45,000 per sqm,” the official said, according to the source.

A senior HRD official later said, “The inflated estimate is not a major issue and can be worked on. However, DU must raise the funds from HEFA, and itself contribute 10% of the costs over 10 years.”
For his part, DU vice-chancellor Yogesh Tyagi confirmed that the estimates were being re-examined. “These are major projects being planned after a long time in the university and will benefit a large number of students,” said Tyagi. The university authorities added that after the estimates are vetted, a fresh proposal would be put before the finance committee before getting the final approval at the Executive Council.
In a letter to DU before the February meeting, MHRD had stated that there would be no new grants-in-aid for infrastructure development. The letter said that all central universities had been instructed to undertake major infrastructure projects through HEFA and not through grants-in-aid from MHRD or the University Grants Commission.
This is the first major development plan in three years, but the finance panel sources said the incumbent administration erred by not consulting CPWD when preparing the project estimates. As another committee member pointed out, “The MHRD nominee cited the figure of Rs 4.2 crore for constructing a reading room and wondered whether the university was planning a reading room or a five-star set-up.”
V K Agrawal, member of the finance committee, however, said DU should demand funds for building the new campuses and hostels instead of going via HEFA. He also asked the vice-chancellor to have the construction rates re-examined."

According to the FIR, the victim had gone to Bhattacharya’s home to study. The incident occurred between 8.30pm and 9pm. One of the neighbours witnessed the crime and recorded it on his mobile. The FIR read that this was a regular occurrence.

The police said the video provided by the neighbours was “conclusive evidence” against the accused and that they will soon record the statement of the girl before a magistrate.
“The media has been talking about a video clip, that was possibly recorded on a mobile phone. We cannot divulge details of the investigation.

It took the police around 20 minutes to rescue him from under the low-floored bus. Till late evening, cops could not ascertain his name. The bus driver was arrested.
Several witnesses said that the bus — that plied on AC-4 route and headed to Howrah from Parnasree — had reached the Red Road-J & N Island crossing in Esplanade when the accident occurred. “The bus was trying to take a tight turn towards Raj Bhawan when the pedestrian suddenly came in front of the bus,” said Saswata Ghosal, a witness.

The bus had a low floor. As a result, the victim got stuck under it. Two ambulances and several police personnel — who were on duty at Esplanade and the Brigade Parade Grounds — reached the spot, but could not pull him out. Several passengers of the bus alighted and frantically tried to reach out to the victim, but in vain.
“We finally had a crane brought to the spot and it lifted the heavy bus that weighed 16,200kg. As soon as the bus was removed, we rescued the victim and took him to the NCB ward of SSKM Hospital. His condition is stated to be critical,” said an officer. “It took us around 20 minutes to execute the entire operation,” he added.

120,"Updated: Apr 3, 2019, 08:43 IST","Mohammad Ibrar / TNN / Updated: Apr 3, 2019, 08:43 IST",BUSINESS NEWS,US robotics give this government school glimpse of future,"NEW DELHI: Himanshu Shakya was pleasantly surprised on Tuesday when he reached school and found his science teacher urging him to rush to the laboratory. Initially circumspect, the 16-year-old was flush with excitement four hours later, having created a soft robot claw.
This was the first time in his 12 years of school that the student of Rajkiya Pratibha Vikas Vidyalaya (RPVV), Dwarka, had made something of his own. And for this, he has Ankur Goel to thank for. The alumni of RPVV, Yamuna Vihar, and fellow at Harvard Biodesign Lab, Massachusetts, US, was at the school to conduct a two-day robotics workshop. “After Class XII, I want to study engineering, and participating in the workshop was a great experience. I am very interested in robotics because I think it is the future,” said a happy Shakya.

On Tuesday Shakya and 14 other Class XII and VIII students attended the workshop. On Monday, 15 Class IX students had done so. They used Harvard Biodesign Lab’s Soft Robotics Toolkit to make the electric claw. The initiative was started by Professor Conor Walsh in collaboration with Professor Donal Holland and is funded by Tata Trusts through The Lakshmi Mittal and Family South Asia Institute, Harvard University.
Goel, 22, explained, “The goal is to educate students in cutting-edge soft robotics research through hands-on learning. Our toolkit team develops low-cost kits that can be used in underprivileged classrooms in India.” Overseeing the workshop was R P Singh, Goel’s teacher at RPVV, Yamuna Vihar, and now the principal of RPVV, Dwarka.

“Having studied in a government school, I understand there are constraints of exposure,” Goel said on why it was important for government schools to have this sort of experience. “When I went to IIT-Delhi, I found people straight out of school comfortably handling materials, unlike me.”
RPVV, Dwarka, was one of the two schools chosen for the workshop, the other being Shiv Nadar School, Noida. Vikas Kumar, Shakya’s classmate, would not stop playing with the silicon in the toolkit and exulted, “I am doing all this for the first time.” And Shakya already saw how his creation could be used: “One can attach the soft robotic claw to a drone for lifting light things.”
Singh was excited to see the curiosity of his students. “They so quickly understood how to make these things. They will never forget it,” he said. And as a participant of Monday’s workshop ran in to ask him for permission to take the claw to show his friends in his colony, the principal smiled broadly, “This is how education should be imparted, with students getting hands-on learning.”
Science teacher Kusum Nagpal is thinking of how to give more students the same experience. “Apart from the silicon, other kit items can be replicated. Maybe we can try with clay,” she said optimistically."

The surgery was done through laparoscopic procedure. Tapati Bhowmik was suffering from an acute stomach ache on the right side of her upper abdomen region.

Having conducted an ultrasonography on the woman, the doctors at AMRI Hospitals, Mukundapur, detected a sizeable obstruction in her gallbladder. However, the 11.6-inch gall bladder is a few inches short of beating the world record. The longest gall bladder was measured 11.8 inches and found in Suman Rao (46), a woman from Churu, Rajasthan in August, 2016. Doctors at Sawai Man Singh Hospital in Jaipur had removed the gall bladder, which was acknowledged by the Guinness Book as the longest gallbladder.
In Kolkata, Sanjoy Mandal, senior GI, laparoscopic and onco surgeon, who conducted the surgery on Bhowmik, decided to conduct a CT scan and found that the gall bladder had extended much beyond its normal size to almost 12 inches, as opposed to the natural length of three to five inches.

The diameter of the gallbladder, which is normally around four millimetres, had also expanded significantly. Mandal extracted the gall bladder along with two gall stones, each almost 3cm in diameter, from the patient through the laparoscopic procedure by stretching two of the holes made in her stomach.
“Even though gall bladder surgeries are common, this case was particularly critical since one of the stones was putting pressure on the bile duct, causing further discomfort to the patient and making further complications, especially due to her pre-existing medical conditions. The patient suffers from pre-existing conditions like COPD, hypothyroidism and diabetes mellitus,” Mandal added."

Documents accessed by TOI show that at present, 147 new guards will be deployed at a cost of Rs 13.6 crore. Six new porta cabins, which will act as beat offices, and 31 patrolling cars and bikes will also be added.

The 7,784-hectare Ridge “is under constant threat of encroachment. Since there are only three rangers, 15 deputy range officers and 77 guards for entire Delhi, additional manpower is required for active patrolling of Ridge areas”, the board observed. The guards will be deployed on a daily basis and paid minimum wages.
Vimlendu Jha, a board member, told TOI that it was agreed that the Ridge needed better protection. Steps will be taken to map the Ridge areas and appoint four project associates. “The current staff did not have the requisite equipment or vehicles to go around. Besides getting more cars and bikes, tractors for plantation and project associates for Ridge demarcation will be hired,” said Jha.
The total cost will be around Rs 19 crore. “The board had unused funds worth nearly Rs 200 crore. We are now looking to use it to protect the Ridge better and improve its habitat,” he added.
National Green Tribunal (NGT) recently rapped the revenue and forest departments for delaying the process of demarcating Delhi Ridge. According to board officials, the south deputy conservator of forests has been asked to prepare maps of the entire Ridge boundary to clearly show the boundary walls and encroachments. “The chief secretary desired that a separate meeting of RMB be called exclusively to discuss the status/progress report on the demarcation of Southern Ridge,” the documents stated.
The board had last year allotted nearly Rs 12 crore for a project in Central Ridge, which involved beautification, nature trails and removal of vilayati kikar in a 10ha area. The project, which is to be executed by Centre for Environmental Management of Degraded Ecosystems (CEMDE), is, however, yet to start.

The new course is expected to be given to colleges as an elective in both the undergraduate and master’s degree programmes.

According to a member of the English department, “The idea behind the new course is to make the undergraduate students view literature through the lens of disability and to evolve in them a fresh critical perspective for reading literary representations and to enable them to explore various forms of literary representations of disability. This will help make them aware of the different ways in which disability figures and operates in a literary narrative.”
In short, this course aims to introduce the undergraduate students to the fundamental tenets of literary and cultural disability studies with the intention of bringing about a change in the way they have traditionally responded to disability and disabled people. Over the past two decades, literary and cultural studies have opened up new spaces from where the traditional notion of disability as a negative difference in relation to normalcy can be challenged.

Raj Kumar, head of the department of English, said that they are looking to make the new syllabus “inclusive.” The objective of disability studies, therefore, he said, was to “include literature from marginal sections to give students a fresh perspective”.
On the MA course, already approved by DU’s Standing committee, faculty member Anil Aneja said it will “promote sensitivity and understanding regarding disability” among future researchers and teachers by engaging students and will “familiarise students with historical outlook, disability theories and issues in relation to socio-cultural context and disability representations in literature”.
The department said that by the end of this course, the students should be able to gain an understanding of issues and concerns of persons with disabilities who are only now being included in the mainstream higher education system, both in terms of numbers and as voices in the academic curriculum. HoD Kumar added that courses on caste are also being planned at both the BA and MA levels."

Sheetal had accused Arif Patel, 44, a transport magnate, Farukh Wadia, 54, and Yasmin Valibhoy, 55, of replacing 31 original paintings belonging to her with copies. A magistrate had held the case to be false and ordered her prosecution.
Dismissing Sheetal’s counsel Mukesh Vashi’s submission that “the magistrate had missed the real controversy’’, Justice Bhatkar confirmed the order, saying: “I do not find any good reason why the police should not launch prosecution against the first informant (Sheetal) as provided under the law.”
The judge also did not accept submissions that Sheetal can be saddled only with costs. Pointing out that the police investigated the case for three years, she said: “Court’s time is unnecessarily taken in this prosecution and thus, in this case, public time and machinery cannot be compensated in terms of money. The law and order cannot be substituted for money, hence the legal action (is) to proceed.”
Vashi said they would consider going to the Supreme Court after studying the HC order.
In 2014, the police cleared her three friends, recommended closure of the case as “false” and sought Sheetal’s prosecution. Referring to the case records and statements of 22 witnesses, the HC said: “This gist gives the entire picture how the duplicate paintings were prepared and replaced and the original paintings were kept under the command of Sheetal Mafatlal. Thus, it ex facie discloses that she has thorough knowledge of what she was doing and where the original paintings are and yet she has registered a false FIR...”
Sheetal challenged the magistrate’s order of May 2015 before sessions judge R G Wankhade, who in September that year set aside the prosecution part of the order, but upheld closure of the theft case. The state government challenged the order in 2016, calling it “erroneous and illegal”. Valibhoy also moved the HC."

He will join top Silicon Valley venture capital (VC) firm Sequoia Capital’s India unit as managing director. The move is likely to be a booster for the startup ecosystem as Anandan will head an initiative launched by the VC firm to back very early stage startups both in India and Southeast Asia. Additionally, Anandan has been a prolific investor in early stage companies personally and is one of the early evangelists of the local internet market.
He will leave Google by the end of the month and is expected to join Sequoia Capital by the second half of the year, continuing to be based out of Delhi. His move comes after a rejig at Google’s operations in the region where Asia-Pacific head Karim Temsamani stepped down in December and was replaced by Greater China and Korea head Scott Beaumont in March.

Anandan’s exit will be a loss to Google as he scaled operations of the company to about $1.3 billion in revenues and was one of the biggest proponents of India’s digital story to the company’s brass. He had said that the next wave of internet consumption will be defined by three themes — voice, video and vernacular — that would catapult millions of new users to consume internet, launching new products targeted at these consumers. Voice queries and vernacular are expected to drive traffic as the number of Indian language users is expected to cross 500 million within two years.
Google India’s country director for sales Vikas Agnihotri will take over as the interim head, according to a statement. “Digital economy in India+SEA: $125B in 2018. 30%++ yoy (year on year) growth (revenues, not users). $500B addressable market by 2023. There simply has not been a better time to #startup in India and SEA!” 50-year-old Anandan tweeted about his move to Sequoia, where he will focused on leading its accelerator initiative Surge.

Sequoia had launched its Surge earlier this year where it plans to pick up 10–20 early stage startups twice every year and invest $1.5 million in each of them at the start of the programme. The new initiative, where Sequoia is likely to invest more than $100 million over the next four-five years, may also lead to the launch of a new fund, two sources had told TOI when the programme was launched. “Rajan’s deep understanding of technology, significant operating expertise and track record of growing tech businesses across the region will help Surge founders scale and build the transformational businesses of tomorrow,” said Sequoia in a statement.
A Sri Lankan Tamil, Anandan will join the other six MDs at Sequoia Capital India, three of whom are based in India and three in Singapore. Sequoia is considered the top VC firm in the US, being an early investor in iconic companies like Apple, Google, WhatsApp, YouTube and PayPal. Its portfolio companies in India include hotels to co-living venture Oyo and food-delivery startup Zomato, besides top companies in Southeast Asia like Indonesian ride-hailing giant Go Jek and online travel firm Traveloka.
His entry would also help the firm, which has raised $3.9 billion across six funds for the region, add firepower to its team as three of the MDs left to set up A91 Partners last year. VCs and entrepreneurs tracking the space said that the move underlines growing maturity for the startup ecosystem, where there are now experienced operators willing to take the plunge. Anandan’s move could set a precedent, they feel.
“His passion and commitment for the early stage ecosystem as an angel investor par excellence and his unique ability to connect with founders will inspire them to think bigger, move faster and be different,” said Ravi Gururaj, president of TiE Bangalore, adding that Anandan brings unique ability to scale up digital and technology revenues from India customers to billion-dollar levels.
A B.Sc in mechanical engineering from MIT with a masters from Stanford, Anandan started his career at McKinsey in the US where he spent over a decade and became partner on a fast track. He then moved to PC maker Dell where he served as executive assistant to founder Michael Dell and then moved to head the company’s business in India in 2006. In 2008, he joined Microsoft as India head and then moved to head Google operations as VP of India sales and operations. He was elevated to lead the Southeast Asia market as well in 2015."

One of the ‘make-or-break’ factors for organisations in a hyper-competitive and complex environment is the quality of their executive team — their top leadership. Unfortunately, this always has remained a neglected area. Partly getting the right talent, internally or externally, is a legitimate challenge. But even more importantly, the unwillingness to bite some bullets is another commonly observed pattern. And without this agenda being addressed, a lot of the strategic thinking and doing could fall between the cracks.

Get the best and keep the best: The war for the right executive talent is intense. People with the right skills and experience, combined with the appropriate softer skills of leadership, are not easy to find or attract. And yet, how do we ensure we follow the “two-pizza rule” for the size of the executive team and not make it an unwieldy exercise in appeasement? (According to the rule, generally attributed to Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, a team is too big if it cannot be fed with two pizzas). For boards and promoters, this must be an unending priority. The size, the mix, the constant struggle to look for and retain exemplary executive talent is a job not to be delegated or outsourced. Moreover, keeping top quality executives is never easy. They are not likely to be obedient and symbolic court poets. They will have a mind of their own and may even bruise a few egos, questioning some from the past. Whether individual ego will prevail over a larger organisational interest is a tough cookie to bite for many.
Ensuring the right dynamics: For chief executives, this must be the toughest challenge to meet after getting the executive talent in. Not everyone is able to forge the right team culture at the top. Creating a shared destiny within the team, encouraging constructive differences, not encouraging dysfunctional behaviours and being ‘true and fair’ with your top team is a CEO’s nightmare. It needs extraordinary wisdom and courage to forge a team of amazingly talented individuals at the top. How many CEOs are rewarded or penalised for something as strategically crucial? Barely any.

Performance & rewards dilemma: At this level, the stakes for rewards are high. Yet, collaboration to deliver a larger shared organisational goal is not axiomatic. Boards must ensure that overly individualistic rewards do not support integrative execution. There must be disproportionate share of the bonus purse for the executive team resting on shared goals. Or else you run the huge risk of siloed behaviour and independent satrapies, which do not support a sustainable organisation.
The ‘Prima Donna’ effect: Even executive teams espousing a commitment to ‘collective responsibility’ run the risk of dealing with overly high-strung individuals. Much of the “I am special” syndrome typically flows either from a perceived higher importance of their agenda or function, a long tenure in the company, or personal political alignment with the promoter or the board. This is obviously dangerous and must not be encouraged. However, in many situations, the obvious advice is observed more in the breach than in the observance. The inability or the unwillingness to rein in such errant behaviour of such strong men (or women) will lead to some other top talent opting to quit the team. The loss then is only the organisation’s.
Lack of inspiring role models: Many executive teams may have the requisite bouquet of functional leaders but lack inspiring role models. One of the biggest expectations of a top executive team is to inspire the larger company and beyond, attract and retain talent as also build a strong corporate brand. Not too many leaders at the top can claim to check these boxes off. In addition, a combination of functional experts is not a surrogate for an inspiring an executive team.
Each person in an organisation — from the doorman to the chairman — will have a view on whether the executive team of the company is indeed thriving or just unwilling to vacate space. The question is how dispassionately do we firm up our view. Still more crucially, how expeditiously do we make our decisions and interventions. The margin for error is barely there. And the clock is fast ticking away.

135,"Apr 3, 2019, 04:19 IST","TNN / Apr 3, 2019, 04:19 IST",CITY NEWS,Delhi schools bound to seek nod for fee hike: DoE,"NEW DELHI: Aam Aadmi Party government on Tuesday filed an appeal before a bigger bench of the Delhi high court against a single judge order permitting private unaided schools in the city to hike fee.
Directorate of education (DoE) has argued that schools are duty-bound to seek prior consent from it before any increase in fee, opposing the recent court decision allowing private unaided schools to go ahead with an interim hike in fee to implement the recommendations of the 7th Central Pay Commission on salaries of teachers and other employees.

In its plea, DoE has also questioned some of the findings of the single judge, claiming that several issues that have been decided were not even raised, such as land allotment liabilities. The appeal is likely to be heard on Wednesday.
The single judge on March 15 had permitted the interim fee hike by quashing a Delhi government circular of April 13 last year, which had prohibited private unaided schools functioning on government land from hiking tuition amount without approval from DoE.

HC, while setting aside the circular, had said the statements of fee submitted by private schools will be subject to scrutiny by DoE “with a view to ensuring that the schools were not indulging in commercialisation of education by resorting to profiteering, or charging of capitation fee.”
“The interim fee hike will operate immediately, in favour of all private unaided schools, without the requirement of any prior approval,” the court had said in its 173-page judgment allowing the plea of Action Committee Unaided Recognised Private Schools, which had challenged the circular.
The court had also made it clear that “if any school is, in fact, found to be indulging in commercialisation of education, DoE will be well within its rights in proceeding, against such institution, in accordance with law, and keeping in mind the provisions of Delhi Schools Education Act and Rules”.
The Action Committee, in its plea, had contended that Delhi Schools Education Act equalised all schools, in the matter of pay and allowances to be granted to teachers and employees and therefore, there was no justification to selectively withdraw the October 17, 2017 order which permitted an interim hike of fee to implement the 7th CPC recommendations.
In its order, DoE had barred schools in the national capital from hiking fees with retrospective effect to implement the 7th Central Pay Commission’s (CPC) recommendations. The schools questioned the reversal of stand, arguing that earlier permission by DoE was “unreasonably withdrawn with retrospective effect” by the April 13, 2018 circular and it showed the Delhi government was delaying implementation of the 7th pay commission’s recommendations in private unaided recognised schools for paying increased salaries and allowances to their teachers and other staff members."

But describing the construction rates quoted in the Rs 4,700-crore plan as “inflated”, the Union human resource development ministry has junked the expansion and advised the university to seek funding through Higher Education Funding Agency (HEFA).

At a meeting of DU’s finance committee in February, the MHRD nominee, who is also a financial advisor in the ministry, objected to the rates quoted by the university’s Building Committee for the construction. Documents on four projects presented at the meeting, copies of which are with TOI, quoted Rs 70,000 per square metre as the construction cost, with the rate for the extension of Central Institute of Education being Rs 76,327 per sqm.
A source present at the meeting reported that the HRD nominee said the correct rate should be in the range of Rs 35,000-45,000 per sqm. “Even in north-east Delhi, where the cost of construction is higher, it is around Rs 45,000 per sqm,” the official said, according to the source.

A senior HRD official later said, “The inflated estimate is not a major issue and can be worked on. However, DU must raise the funds from HEFA, and itself contribute 10% of the costs over 10 years.”
For his part, DU vice-chancellor Yogesh Tyagi confirmed that the estimates were being re-examined. “These are major projects being planned after a long time in the university and will benefit a large number of students,” said Tyagi. The university authorities added that after the estimates are vetted, a fresh proposal would be put before the finance committee before getting the final approval at the Executive Council.
In a letter to DU before the February meeting, MHRD had stated that there would be no new grants-in-aid for infrastructure development. The letter said that all central universities had been instructed to undertake major infrastructure projects through HEFA and not through grants-in-aid from MHRD or the University Grants Commission.
This is the first major development plan in three years, but the finance panel sources said the incumbent administration erred by not consulting CPWD when preparing the project estimates. As another committee member pointed out, “The MHRD nominee cited the figure of Rs 4.2 crore for constructing a reading room and wondered whether the university was planning a reading room or a five-star set-up.”
V K Agrawal, member of the finance committee, however, said DU should demand funds for building the new campuses and hostels instead of going via HEFA. He also asked the vice-chancellor to have the construction rates re-examined."

It took the police around 20 minutes to rescue him from under the low-floored bus. Till late evening, cops could not ascertain his name. The bus driver was arrested.
Several witnesses said that the bus — that plied on AC-4 route and headed to Howrah from Parnasree — had reached the Red Road-J & N Island crossing in Esplanade when the accident occurred. “The bus was trying to take a tight turn towards Raj Bhawan when the pedestrian suddenly came in front of the bus,” said Saswata Ghosal, a witness.

The bus had a low floor. As a result, the victim got stuck under it. Two ambulances and several police personnel — who were on duty at Esplanade and the Brigade Parade Grounds — reached the spot, but could not pull him out. Several passengers of the bus alighted and frantically tried to reach out to the victim, but in vain.
“We finally had a crane brought to the spot and it lifted the heavy bus that weighed 16,200kg. As soon as the bus was removed, we rescued the victim and took him to the NCB ward of SSKM Hospital. His condition is stated to be critical,” said an officer. “It took us around 20 minutes to execute the entire operation,” he added.

Initially circumspect, the 16-year-old was flush with excitement four hours later, having created a soft robot claw.
This was the first time in his 12 years of school that the student of Rajkiya Pratibha Vikas Vidyalaya (RPVV), Dwarka, had made something of his own. And for this, he has Ankur Goel to thank for. The alumni of RPVV, Yamuna Vihar, and fellow at Harvard Biodesign Lab, Massachusetts, US, was at the school to conduct a two-day robotics workshop. “After Class XII, I want to study engineering, and participating in the workshop was a great experience. I am very interested in robotics because I think it is the future,” said a happy Shakya.

On Tuesday Shakya and 14 other Class XII and VIII students attended the workshop. On Monday, 15 Class IX students had done so. They used Harvard Biodesign Lab’s Soft Robotics Toolkit to make the electric claw. The initiative was started by Professor Conor Walsh in collaboration with Professor Donal Holland and is funded by Tata Trusts through The Lakshmi Mittal and Family South Asia Institute, Harvard University.
Goel, 22, explained, “The goal is to educate students in cutting-edge soft robotics research through hands-on learning. Our toolkit team develops low-cost kits that can be used in underprivileged classrooms in India.” Overseeing the workshop was R P Singh, Goel’s teacher at RPVV, Yamuna Vihar, and now the principal of RPVV, Dwarka.

“Having studied in a government school, I understand there are constraints of exposure,” Goel said on why it was important for government schools to have this sort of experience. “When I went to IIT-Delhi, I found people straight out of school comfortably handling materials, unlike me.”
RPVV, Dwarka, was one of the two schools chosen for the workshop, the other being Shiv Nadar School, Noida. Vikas Kumar, Shakya’s classmate, would not stop playing with the silicon in the toolkit and exulted, “I am doing all this for the first time.” And Shakya already saw how his creation could be used: “One can attach the soft robotic claw to a drone for lifting light things.”
Singh was excited to see the curiosity of his students. “They so quickly understood how to make these things. They will never forget it,” he said. And as a participant of Monday’s workshop ran in to ask him for permission to take the claw to show his friends in his colony, the principal smiled broadly, “This is how education should be imparted, with students getting hands-on learning.”
Science teacher Kusum Nagpal is thinking of how to give more students the same experience. “Apart from the silicon, other kit items can be replicated. Maybe we can try with clay,” she said optimistically."

The surgery was done through laparoscopic procedure. Tapati Bhowmik was suffering from an acute stomach ache on the right side of her upper abdomen region.

Having conducted an ultrasonography on the woman, the doctors at AMRI Hospitals, Mukundapur, detected a sizeable obstruction in her gallbladder. However, the 11.6-inch gall bladder is a few inches short of beating the world record. The longest gall bladder was measured 11.8 inches and found in Suman Rao (46), a woman from Churu, Rajasthan in August, 2016. Doctors at Sawai Man Singh Hospital in Jaipur had removed the gall bladder, which was acknowledged by the Guinness Book as the longest gallbladder.
In Kolkata, Sanjoy Mandal, senior GI, laparoscopic and onco surgeon, who conducted the surgery on Bhowmik, decided to conduct a CT scan and found that the gall bladder had extended much beyond its normal size to almost 12 inches, as opposed to the natural length of three to five inches.

The 7,784-hectare Ridge “is under constant threat of encroachment. Since there are only three rangers, 15 deputy range officers and 77 guards for entire Delhi, additional manpower is required for active patrolling of Ridge areas”, the board observed. The guards will be deployed on a daily basis and paid minimum wages.
Vimlendu Jha, a board member, told TOI that it was agreed that the Ridge needed better protection. Steps will be taken to map the Ridge areas and appoint four project associates. “The current staff did not have the requisite equipment or vehicles to go around. Besides getting more cars and bikes, tractors for plantation and project associates for Ridge demarcation will be hired,” said Jha.
The total cost will be around Rs 19 crore. “The board had unused funds worth nearly Rs 200 crore. We are now looking to use it to protect the Ridge better and improve its habitat,” he added.
National Green Tribunal (NGT) recently rapped the revenue and forest departments for delaying the process of demarcating Delhi Ridge. According to board officials, the south deputy conservator of forests has been asked to prepare maps of the entire Ridge boundary to clearly show the boundary walls and encroachments. “The chief secretary desired that a separate meeting of RMB be called exclusively to discuss the status/progress report on the demarcation of Southern Ridge,” the documents stated.
The board had last year allotted nearly Rs 12 crore for a project in Central Ridge, which involved beautification, nature trails and removal of vilayati kikar in a 10ha area. The project, which is to be executed by Centre for Environmental Management of Degraded Ecosystems (CEMDE), is, however, yet to start.

According to a member of the English department, “The idea behind the new course is to make the undergraduate students view literature through the lens of disability and to evolve in them a fresh critical perspective for reading literary representations and to enable them to explore various forms of literary representations of disability. This will help make them aware of the different ways in which disability figures and operates in a literary narrative.”
In short, this course aims to introduce the undergraduate students to the fundamental tenets of literary and cultural disability studies with the intention of bringing about a change in the way they have traditionally responded to disability and disabled people. Over the past two decades, literary and cultural studies have opened up new spaces from where the traditional notion of disability as a negative difference in relation to normalcy can be challenged.

Raj Kumar, head of the department of English, said that they are looking to make the new syllabus “inclusive.” The objective of disability studies, therefore, he said, was to “include literature from marginal sections to give students a fresh perspective”.
On the MA course, already approved by DU’s Standing committee, faculty member Anil Aneja said it will “promote sensitivity and understanding regarding disability” among future researchers and teachers by engaging students and will “familiarise students with historical outlook, disability theories and issues in relation to socio-cultural context and disability representations in literature”.
The department said that by the end of this course, the students should be able to gain an understanding of issues and concerns of persons with disabilities who are only now being included in the mainstream higher education system, both in terms of numbers and as voices in the academic curriculum. HoD Kumar added that courses on caste are also being planned at both the BA and MA levels."

Justice Mridula Bhatkar upheld a 2015 order of a magistrate for her prosecution and partially set aside a sessions court order that had saved her from it. The HC also imposed Rs 7 lakh as cost on Sheetal, of which she has to pay Rs 5 lakh to the police welfare fund and Rs 2 lakh to the state legal aid services authority in the Manodhairya scheme within two weeks.


If convicted of the charges slapped on her (see box), Sheetal could face up to seven years in jail.

Sheetal had accused Arif Patel, 44, a transport magnate, Farukh Wadia, 54, and Yasmin Valibhoy, 55, of replacing 31 original paintings belonging to her with copies. A magistrate had held the case to be false and ordered her prosecution.
Dismissing Sheetal’s counsel Mukesh Vashi’s submission that “the magistrate had missed the real controversy’’, Justice Bhatkar confirmed the order, saying: “I do not find any good reason why the police should not launch prosecution against the first informant (Sheetal) as provided under the law.”
The judge also did not accept submissions that Sheetal can be saddled only with costs. Pointing out that the police investigated the case for three years, she said: “Court’s time is unnecessarily taken in this prosecution and thus, in this case, public time and machinery cannot be compensated in terms of money. The law and order cannot be substituted for money, hence the legal action (is) to proceed.”
Vashi said they would consider going to the Supreme Court after studying the HC order.
In 2014, the police cleared her three friends, recommended closure of the case as “false” and sought Sheetal’s prosecution. Referring to the case records and statements of 22 witnesses, the HC said: “This gist gives the entire picture how the duplicate paintings were prepared and replaced and the original paintings were kept under the command of Sheetal Mafatlal. Thus, it ex facie discloses that she has thorough knowledge of what she was doing and where the original paintings are and yet she has registered a false FIR...”
Sheetal challenged the magistrate’s order of May 2015 before sessions judge R G Wankhade, who in September that year set aside the prosecution part of the order, but upheld closure of the theft case. The state government challenged the order in 2016, calling it “erroneous and illegal”. Valibhoy also moved the HC."

The agency has submitted the complaint to the Maharashtra Association of Practising Pathologists and Microbiologists (MAPPM) as well as Maharashtra Medical Council (MMC) in this regard. The malpractice came to light during investigation of various claims submitted by patients to the insurance agency.
The woman pathologist’s signed reports were being given to patients at laboratories on Satana Road in Solapur, Phursungi, Rajgurunagar, Alandi and Haveli in Pune district. “We will recommend insurance firms to dishonour the claims supported by such reports,” an official of the insurance company stated in a letter addressed to the MAPPM.
Pathologist Prasad Kulkarni, executive council member of MAPPM, said, “We have forwarded the information of her malpractices to MMC. We have also requested the insurance agency to publish public notification blacklisting her.”
The erring pathologist can be tried for these malpractices under the Medical Practitioners Act, 1961.
A Supreme Court ruling of December 2017 clearly stated that laboratory reports can be countersigned only by a registered medical practitioner with a postgraduate qualification in pathology. “How can a pathologist be present at laboratories at so many different locations around the same time?” Kulkarni asked.
An MMC official said, “We will scrutinise the complaint letter.”"

Already, a total of Rs 34.34 crore tax settlement is pending at the mutt and tax department had sent a notice to Sode Mutt, its dwanda mutt (twin mutt), asking it to clear it.
This year, the tax department had originally sent a notice for Rs 17 crore to the mutt on its income from various properties. When the mutt approached the I-T department, the latter took a sympathetic view of the condition at the mutt and reduced 80% of the tax amount, asking it to pay only its 20%, which is Rs 3.46 crore.
Now, until the I-T dues are cleared, appointment of a new seer is not possible. Even if a new seer is appointed, he will be busy settling these dues, instead of concentrating on mutt' s activities.
The sudden death of Sri Lakshmivara Teertha, head pontiff of Shiroor Mutt due to multi-organ failure, led to Sode Vadiaraja seer taking over the mutt’s administration. Though it was decided then to appoint a new head at the mutt within six months, it did not materialise, prompting disciples to seek an explanation and organise a meeting on Sunday.
Sri Vishwavalabh Tirtha Swamiji of Sode Mutt said, “Until tax and other financial hurdles are resolved, appointment of a new seer to the mutt is not possible. The new seer, who succeeds Sri Lakshmivara Teertha, should focus on bhakti, knowledge and ‘vairagya’ and cannot work on resolving existing court cases and other hurdles. Moreover, at present, the condition of the mutt is pathetic and looking at the situation, no one is ready to come forward to take the responsibility as successor. Just matching the horoscope is not enough.”
Earlier, the Shiroor swamiji and Thonse Jayakrishna Shetty, a businessman, together planned to start a Kanaka Mall at mutt’s property at Kalasanka. For this, they had applied for a loan of Rs 25 crore from Corporation Bank in Manipal. The bank released a loan of Rs 16 crore. However, the construction stopped midway as a dispute arose between the two. Jayakrishna had taken advance from many people promising to give a shop in the mall. However, when the work stopped, the bank issued a notice to both and eventually the property was seized. Hence, Jayakrishna filed a case, which is still being heard in the high court.
In addition to it, Shiroor mutt has been renovated with Rs 25 lakh and more money is required for further renovation before a new seer takes over. Currently, the daily expenses of the mutt is being met with the rent received from other buildings. Shiroor seer had only Rs 10 lakh fixed deposit as asset.
Meanwhile, one of the swamis at the mutt said they had chosen a successor for the late pontiff. They, however, do not want to reveal his name. He is studying in the mutt. After training him and looking at his performance, a decision would be taken on appointing him as the pontiff in two to three years, he said."

The former chief minister has till April 9 to file his reply.
Last Friday, Digvijaya was scheduled to hold a party workers’ meeting at Raj Garden in Lunia Chouraha of Sehore. On the way, he stopped for prayers at Chintaman Ganesh temple in the town. The video, shared widely on social media, shows him allegedly handing Rs 20 notes to some women beggars.
State BJP vice-president Vijesh Lunawat filed a complaint with EC on Saturday, alleging violation of model mode of conduct. SDM Varun Kumar Awasthi has issued a notice to Digvijaya, asking for his explanation. Sehore collector Ganesh Shankar Mishra pointed out that Sehore is within Bhopal parliamentary constituency. “The model code of conduct is in effect and any candidate or political party giving money, for no apparent reason, is violation of the model code of conduct. The BJP had lodged a complaint,” Mishra said.
The state Congress defended Digvijaya and argued that it’s not a violation of model code of conduct. Speaking to TOI, state Congress media department convener Narendra Saluja said, “This doesn’t qualify to be a violation of model code of conduct. In Indian tradition and culture, any religious person visiting a temple does some charity by helping needy persons. It’s BJP’s degraded mentality that they see model code of conduct violation in a religious tradition. Perhaps, BJP does not believe in helping the poor and needy sitting outside temples.”
Lunawat retaliated by saying, “Digvijaya Singh’s dirty tricks are not going to work in Bhopal. He is visiting temples by day and dargahs by night. The man who accosted Hindus and RSS for years has suddenly turned pro-Hindu. During democratic elections, political parties have to abide by the law, EC and model code of conduct — all of which are being disregarded by Congress.”"

He uses only basic drugs and mixtures for relieving many aches and pains.
An age-old ‘turpentine liniment’ – a liquid preparation for body aches, a gooey pinkish-red syrup ‘linctus’ for easing cough and boric acid, an anti-fungal cure-all of sorts are the constants in his pharmacy. A basic antibiotic like oxytetracycline is his choice of drug for treating bacterial infections.
“I dispense these drugs to my patients from my pharmacy as per their need. I avoid giving stronger antibiotics and I don’t write prescriptions,” he said.
When it comes to diagnoses, Ghatpande relies more on clinic assessment. “I use a stethoscope, check the pulse rate and make use of my palms to sense the patient’s body type. This triad forms the core of my clinical diagnosis,” he said.
Kashinath Vitekar, 75, a resident of Kasba Peth, is among his many loyal patients.
“He never asks for lab reports. A few doses of capsules, tablets and a liquid mixture he gives always do the trick. I have never ever visited another doctor in my life,” Vitekar said.
Jayant Salunkhe, who lives in Dhayari, comes all the way to Ghatpande’s clinic in Raviwar Peth for treatment. “Be it any seasonal ailment, we get relief in just two days,” Salunkhe said.
His consultation charges are Rs 30. ""His fee has remained the same for many years. For medicines, he charges you additionally,"" Salunkhe said.
Like his medical work, his way of living is equally simple and uncomplicated. “I eat food that it is easy to cook and digest,” he said.
His advises a diet that is twice a day or small portions throughout the day. “I will suggest twice a day. But I think more than that it is important to have a very clear understanding of one’s digestion capacity. I never overeat,” he said.
His daily regimen includes an hour-long session of physical exercises. “I never miss that. I do sit-ups, practise some drills on the lezim (wooden sticks with jingling cymbals attached to it),” he said.
Is there any other secret formula he follows to keep fit? “There is no secret formula. You have to make your own formula and follow it religiously. Whatever I do, my principle is keep it simple,” he said, adding, “I work all the days of the week and never indulge in too much rest.”
Ghatpande’s eldest daughter is seventy-eight years old. “She is a psychiatrist and lives a retired life in US,” his aide Mangesh Darje shared.
Both his sons are doctors. Swanand is 74 and Sudhir, the younger son, died last year at the age of 69 following illness. His wife died four years ago when she was 92.
Darje oversees his food preparations at home. “He never eats any outside food. Whatever he eats has to be home cooked. He likes spices in his food,” Darje said
“He drinks buttermilk made from curd set at home with lunch. Another constant in his food is green chilly chutney with coriander. He likes to have poha soaked in milk or curd. He never eats curd or buttermilk in the evening,” he said.
Ghatpande is a voracious reader. “He reads six newspapers at different times throughout the day,” Darje said.
Born on March 15, 1915, Ghatpande received his four-and-half-year-old medical degree during British rule in 1941.
“For every six months of the course, I would pay the fees of Rs 90 to my alma mater, B J Medical School,” he said.
In 1946, B J Medical School was upgraded to B J Medical College. Ghatpande is perhaps among the few living doctors with Licentiate in Medicine and Surgery (LMS) which he received in 1941.
The medical degree was replaced with Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS) at Bhore Committee's recommendations in 1946.
On the root cause of rising cases of assaults on doctors, he said, “Dialogue with the patient is important. Doctors these days are overburdened so they find little time to strike up a conversation with patients,” he said."

This is the first that the church has been inviting youngsters to be part of the poll process, who have so far been aloof from the important process of elections. According to church leaders, the youth have been roped in at a time when the Vatican celebrates, ‘Year of Youth-2019’. Apart from it, church leaders along with priests have been holding meetings at the church and ward levels to convince its parishioners to come in large number to exercise their franchise on the day of voting.
“Though Christians vote, their percentage in voting is less than other communities. Most of our votes are not cast, since thousands of the members of our community reside abroad, and many of those who reside here don’t turn up to vote. As a result, we decided to give youngsters the opportunity to create awareness on voting as a part of the ‘Year of Youth-2019’ initiative. The youth were given the opportunity to help people who failed to obtain their voter IDs. This includes first-time voters as well. They have also been given the task to create awareness among members of the community to exercise their franchise without fail,” said a priest on condition of anonymity.
A youth said they have been actively involved in encouraging community members to vote, and to help them get voter ID cards. “As youth, we feel proud to work as volunteers and create awareness among the community as well as those from outside the community on elections and the importance of voting. Our aim is to ensure that a maximum number of people vote,” said a youth.
Awareness is being created and meetings have been organised at the parish level, asking people to vote for the candidate of their choice. Most Rev Peter Paul Saldanha, bishop, Diocese of Mangalore, said that a circular has been sent to all churches, asking members of the community to vote without fail. He has asked people to vote for those candidates who protect democracy and secularism. “Apart from youth and the Catholic Sabha, a group of laity also have been involved in creating awareness on elections and voting,” added Paul Saldanha."

MBBS doctors who have cleared PG-NEET claimed their careers are in serious peril due to the new reservations for Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (SEBC — popularly known as Maratha reservation), and Economically Weaker Sections (EWS) in PG seats. They have sought an appointment with chief minister Devendra Fadnavis to discuss the possible solutions to this issue and their future prospects.
“Only 233 seats are available for 2,054 MBBS doctors from open category who have qualified for PG admissions. Even if we add 37 seats in private medical colleges, only 270 seats are available for general category students. This type of implementation will be the end of meritorious students in Maharashtra,” said Dr Sameer Deshmukh, a resident at GMC.
The seat matrix declared by the CET Cell says 3,913 candidates have qualified for PG admissions in Maharashtra for 1,441 PG seats. Out of these, 2,024 candidates belong to open category. For them, 233 seats are available in all state-run GMCs. These seats can be claimed by reserved candidates as well.
Condition in private medical colleges is even worse. As 16% of SEBC cannot be implemented in management and NRI quota of private colleges, the government has added this number to the state quota, which has increased SEBC quota to nearly 30%, eventually leaving only 37 seats for general category students in private medical colleges.
Dr TP Lahane, Director of Medical Education and Research, Maharashtra state, said general category students should go for seats of management quota in private medical colleges.
“It’s a fact that only 37 seats are available for general category students in private colleges. We had no option but to implement the reservation as the high court has directed the same. However, we have deliberately kept the management quota and NRI quota out of any reservation. All 215 seats are available for general category students,” he said.
However, fees in management and NRI quota is three to five times higher than the state quota seats, so this suggestion has left the protesting students angry.
ISSUE AT A GLANCE
UNTIL NOW: Reservation limited to 52% in Maharashtra
NOW: Reservation rises to 78% after including SEBC and EWS quota
EWS Reservation: 10 % EWS reservation introduced in Feb 2019 by central government and hastily implemented in Maharashtra within months, despite assurances from the centre about proportionate (25%) increment in seats soon
SEBC reservation: 16% SEBC reservation (Maratha reservation) introduced on November 30, 2018, by state government and implemented in this session. Doctors claim this is against the SEBC Act, which says “new reservation shall not be implemented after commencement of admission procedure, which includes commencement of registration for the entrance exam for admission”. NEET-PG registration began on November 2, 2018, almost a month before SEBC was announced
Can MBBS doctor be educationally backward? General category students say the MBBS degree in itself a great equalizer and it is unfair to pit one doctor against another on the basis of ‘social and educational backwardness’

Addressing roadshows at Tekkali in Srikakulam district and Vizag city on Tuesday, Raghuveera Reddy said it was time to teach a lesson to political forces backed by Modi.
Coming down heavily on BJP, Raghuveera said the BJP government has cheated people of Andhra Pradesh by not granting the Special Category Status (SCS) to Andhra Pradesh and by ignoring other provisions of the AP Reorganisation Act-2014. TDP and YSRC also failed to put pressure on BJP over the SCS, he added.
Congress will grant Andhra Pradesh the promised SCS and honour the commitment given at the time of bifurcation, he said. Raghuveera said after becoming Prime Minister, Rahul Gandhi would put his first signature on the SCS file. He appealed to the people to vote for Congress candidates for a bright future of the state."

He was in Dakshina Kannada to campaign for Congress Lok Sabha candidate Mithun M Rai. Addressing the media, he attacked the Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led government and said that the government is threatening whoever raises their voice against it through IT raids, controlling the media and using blackmailing tactics. “So this Modi raj is mafia raj,” he said.
He continued his tirade, alleging that Modi was sowing Hindutva and spreading communal opium among the people of the country. “This is because the BJP has nothing concrete to speak about in terms of development and real issues. When the reality is grim, the saffron party talks about Hindutva and makes hateful speeches to incite the people. Today the country is suffering a great agrarian crisis but no one is raising their voice on this issue,” he criticised.
‘Setting fire to district is Kateel’s achievement’
On fighting the Lok Sabha election in the Dakshina Kannada constituency, Rao said that the Congress party leaders and members were united. “There is a wave for change, and most of the party members have shown that they are supporting the Congress candidate. Importantly, senior Congress leader Janardhana Poojary himself has blessed our candidate and the party. It is the biggest blessing for the party,” he said. “Nalin Kumar Kateel, who was elected twice on a BJP ticket, has turned out to be the biggest failure. He has not taken up any development works despite his party being in power at the Centre. Kateel has made a name only for setting fire to the district, but not for development works,” Dinesh said.
‘Manifesto is inclusive’
On the Congress manifesto which was released on Tuesday, Dinesh said that the party speaks about inclusiveness, which assures of being beyond caste and religion. “It wishes to give a healing touch to the people of India, who have been devastated after demonetisation and GST. It has assured of giving 33 per cent reservation for women in Parliament as well as in the job sector. We have also promised 9 per cent of GDP to be set aside and spent on education and health,” he said. “Modi is a marketing genius and speaks only lies. However, Congress delivers what is promised, which is evident in Karnataka,” he added.
‘We requested Rahul to contest from K’tka but he chose Wayanad’
Dinesh said that he, along with other senior leaders, had requested Congress president Rahul Gandhi to contest from Karnataka. “Soon after that, Congress leaders from Kerala and Tamil Nadu also requested him to contest from their states. Finally, Rahul chose to contest the Lok Sabha elections from Wayanad,” he said.
When asked if Rahul was contesting from the seat as it was considered safe? he said, “If Wayanad is a safe place for Rahul Gandhi to contest the election, then it is the same with Varanasi for Narendra Modi.”"

D B Mehta, president, Confederation of Real Estate Developers’ Associations of India (CREDAI), Mangaluru, told TOI, that on the policy side there are certain issues which led to this. “Revision of zonal regulation that was on the cards has been deferred by two months. Both Mangaluru Urban Development Authority (Muda) and Mangaluru City Corporation (MCC) are run by administrators. With the deputy commissioner busy with election duty, decisions are being delayed in both these bodies. The government decided not to make property cards mandatory till May 15, but there is a delay in the issue of property cards along with software issues.” he said. “We are expecting a limbo from May 15 till May 23, as no registrations can take place without property cards. If for 10-15 days, properties are not registered, especially apartments built and sold, the problems faced by the industry will only worsen. On property cards, CREDAI will seek an extension from the deputy commissioner, after the polling date of April 18,” said Mehta.
Explaining issues on the business front, he said, “Home buyers are adapting to a wait and watch policy and want the formation of a stable government, irrespective of the party. Stability is important for economic growth and development. Enquires for commercial and residential properties have dropped by 75 per cent, indicating that people are politically aware of issues, and economic decisions are now being made based on the political outcome that is expected. This trend was unseen and unheard of, even during the last Lok Sabha or assembly polls,” said Mehta, attributing this trend to the social media.
While many clients have put investments on hold, Mehta feels it would be ideal for the nation to go for polls in just three phases, and complete the entire process in 15-20 days. “The economy is getting affected. Once bookings reduce, the flow of funds gets affected, thus having an impact on execution,” he said.
“Real estate slowdown has been recorded across the country since March, as the government brought down the GST rates, which is being implemented from April 1. People have thus postponed investments on purchase of homes,” he said. “Even at the national level, there is a slowdown visible in the collection of income tax in the month of March 2019 compared to March 2018, and the government is looking at a revenue shortfall of almost Rs 1 lakh core,” Mehta explained."

The first day of the current fiscal saw Vijaya Bank and Dena Bank get amalgamated with BoB as part of the first-ever three-way consolidation of banks after SBI subsumed its five subsidiaries.
For Ravindranath Uchil, who superannuated from the rolls of Vijaya Bank in 2012 after 38 years of service, it was a moment to take a trip down memory lane. Having joined the bank in 1974, Ravindranath told TOI that the bank reached its heydays two years later under the stewardship of then CMD Mulki Sunder Ram Shetty. “It was a golden year in the bank’s history. It excelled in terms of percentage of business and profits,” he said.
It was also the year when the bank opened highest number of branches to spread the vision of its founding fathers: to help the agrarian population in this part of the state. A resident of Manjeshwar, Ravindranath was posted to Ernakulam. “I was posted there as I know Malayalam,” he said, adding most of his batchmates were posted to north India. “Our chairman never posted anyone in their home location,” Ravindranath added.
The only employees who escaped this were women and widows who were given posting at branches closer home. “His (Sunder Ram Shetty’s) only words while handing out the employment letter, which he personally did, was to tell employees to do their best and live up to the aspirations of the founding fathers,” Ravindranath said, adding this worked.
Such was their sense of dedication that employees on rolls of Vijaya Bank turned down lucrative job offers from elsewhere. Ravindranath recalled that Kochi Refineries offered him a job at Qatar on better terms. “It was the love for Vijaya Bank and the trust that Sunder Ram Shetty had reposed in us that saw most of us reject such offers,” he said, adding he would still go around proudly claiming to be a former employee of Vijaya Bank."
165,"Updated: Apr 3, 2019, 10:43 IST","TNN / Updated: Apr 3, 2019, 10:43 IST",NAGPUR NEWS,Marwari Horses Race Again,"Pune: After nearly one and a half decades, one of India’s indigenous breeds, the Marwari horses, raced on the tracks of the Pune Race Course earlier this month.
The horses with their unique inward turning ears and wideset eyes once again exhibited that they can hit and own the tracks in their own right.
The efforts of the Indigenous Horse Owners Association (IHOA) have ensured that the Marwari horses, once again, get the opportunity to show their grit.
The races were part of the fourth edition of the Marwari Horse Show organized in the city. The association continues to strive to meet its target of having a platform for these smaller horses to display their calibre.
Marwari horse breeder and member of IHOA, Harsh Lunia, said, “We want to see 400 metre, 600 metre and 800 metre races at the Race Courses meant for Marwari horses. We want races built around these horses capability so that the calibre of these indigenous horses can be proved.”
President of the association, Ajay Nensee said, “Issues pertaining to medical protocol had led to discontinuation of the Marwari horses in the Gymkhana Races. However, there is once again an opportunity for these horses. Racing is at an all-time low due to the introduction of Goods and Services Tax as 40 % of the stables at Royal Western India Turf Club (RWITC) are empty. If one race is organised per weekend for Marwari horses, wherein all medical protocols are followed and with the same trainers that breed thoroughbreds, the breed will get the much needed boost. We are set to initiate dialogue with the RWITC.”
According to Nensee, thoroughbred horses are bred and trained for speed. “The fastest running stallion and mare are bred for perfect results. However, that is not the case for Marwari horses. In many parts of the country, horses are pride animals and bought only with that intention. We want to change this mindset regarding Marwari horses and are thus promoting their use in sports. These horses are now participating in endurance races. The level of showing of these horses has also been taken to another level with electronic judging for a logical and fair system. When the horse becomes an athlete, the purpose of breeding of the Marwari horses will change,” he explained.
In the first edition of the Marwari Horse Show, there were about 60 to 70 entries. “This year, we had about 135 entries. There is no strong data to prove so but the number of Marwari horses is constantly growing. We have about 100 members now from across Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Gujarat and even the Southern states. The horses have now been accepted by the Equestrian Federation of India and are competing,” Lunia added.
Lunia said they have not defined a good blood line stock when it comes to Marwari horses. The breed specifications aren’t in place either. In case of thoroughbreds, one can know the blood line and the price. They are an organised industry, he said.
Meanwhile, Nensee said, “We do not have enough veterinarian support as there are not many who specialize in equine. In Maharashtra, there are three to four good quality doctors but they are not available on time or for follow-ups. Several vets have showed interest in training camps, but one-day training is insufficient. There is a need for good quality breeding stations and a full-fledged breeding programme.”
Equine trainer and horse breaker, Rasika Reddy, said thoroughbreds are a product of breeding between four Arab stallions and English mares. What came from the breeding was a fine breed which was fast. Due to this, people began racing with these horses. One needs to look back to seven generations of the horse to establish that it is a thoroughbred.
To get Marwari horses to race adds another dimension to the breed. While these horses do get to perform in areas of Gujarat and Rajasthan, it is mainly a cultural affair. However, if these horses can demonstrate that they can race, it would be amazing, she added."

On a whim, she started browsing through her food ordering app when she found what she was looking for --- piping hot tea delivered straight home.
Half expecting how it would turn out to be, Khaladkarr ordered a special chai from Adhya Amrutulya in Raviwar Peth on the food ordering platform. “The delivery was swift and I was happy that l could finally have tea. Moreover, it was the best tea I have had in years,” she recalls.
But little did she know that the tea she had was from one of the oldest tea joints in the city until one of her friends told her so. “I thought it was from one of those fancy tea shops that had come up in the vicinity,” she says.
Set up on July 27, 1924, Adhya Amrutulya has moved with the times to reach out to tea lovers in the city. “When we started our business, the population of Pune was around 15,000. Now it is nearly 50 lakh. The city has grown so much that not everybody can come to us, so we decided to reach out to our customers,” says owner Rahul Nartekar, a fourth generation entrepreneur.
“In fact, we are one of the first tea joints in the city to deliver tea on food delivery platforms such as Zomato, Food Panda and Swiggy. We typically cater to customers within a range of 3-5 km as the packaging we use keeps the tea warm for around 20 minutes. We receive maximum orders online between Friday and Sunday, mostly from Bhandarkar Road, Prabhat Road, Nal Stop, East Street, Swargate, Shivaji Nagar and Kasba Peth,” he says.
But Nartekar insists that they have only tweaked their business model but haven't really changed with the times. “Our taste has remained the same over the years. The tea is still prepared by hand and is made hundreds of times a day. We don't prepare tea for more than 15 to 20 cups at a time. So, every time you have tea at our shop, it tastes fresh.""
In fact, they continue to make the same types of tea and coffee which were popular in the 1920s and 1930s. “We make black tea, sada tea, special tea, fakkad chai (boiled in milk) as well as black coffee, sada coffee and special coffee. Our tea used to cost ek anna in 1924, though the minimum price of tea is now Rs15. While special tea costs Rs 25, fakkad costs Rs 30. Our special tea, which is made using different types of masalas, is very popular among our customers,” says Nartekar.
Though the shop used to earlier sell various types of sweets such as rasgulla and pedhe, they have been discontinued with. Currently, it sells misal pav, wada pav, adraki poha and upma. “My great grandfather Vishwanath Nartekar introduced the food items after his tea business took off,” says Nartekar.
Interestingly, tea wasn’t the first business of Nartekars. “We used to have bhang ka gota here, but after having bhang people generally need tea. So my great grandfather thought of opening a tea shop here so that people can have bhang and tea at the same place. He made up his mind to make tea in such a way that it would be amrutulya, akin to nectar,” he says.
The shop used to be frequented by many freedom fighters. “Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru had tea from our shop,” says Nartekar. In fact, the shop has been popular with singers, film stars and politicians too.
“There is a recording studio -- Melody Makers -- diagonally opposite to our shop where singers like Lata Mangeshkar, Mohammed Rafi, Kishore Kumar and Asha Bhosale would record. It was a ritual for them to have tea from our shop before any recording,” notes Nartekar.
“Our shop has been a favourite haunt of politicians too like Sharad Pawar, Balasaheb Thackeray, Patangrao Kadam, Suresh Kalmadi, Girish Bapat and others.”
Adhya Amrutulya sells more than 3,000 cups of tea every day. “We have maximum customers between 6am and 10 am and between 4pm and 7pm. We serve tea in a special kulhar to keep it warm. Food is served on a plate and bowl made of single wood. We have kept the look and feel as it was in then. For us, it is no longer a business but an effort to keep a tradition alive,” stresses Nartekar.
For the last nice decades, the Nartekars have been sourcing tea dust from Kerala. “We buy a special variety of golden tea dust from there. All the masalas that we use to make tea are also sourced from there. We make several trips to Kerala every year to source the right quality of tea,” he points out.
Now, Nartekar wants to come up with packaged tea under the brand name Adhya Amrutulya. “It will hit the market next year. It will be available in tetra packs too. We will come up with different varieties -- black tea, green tea, lemon tea etc. To deliver tea on food delivery platforms, we are working on a different type of packaging to keep the beverage warm for around 30 minutes,” he says.
Nartekar is hardly bothered about the mushrooming of amrutulyas in the city. “We are not in any competition with anybody. There are two types of tea drinkers – those who drink tea because it is tea time and then there are those who are lovers of tea. We have lovers of tea coming to our shop for generations,” he says."

According to her family, Payal Mishra (in her 20s) was admitted to the hospital following complaints of stomach pain and swelling on June 9, 2007. But the hospital allegedly administered her anti-TB drugs leading to deterioration in her health. The doctors denied the allegations saying “she was never diagnosed or treated for TB at the hospital”.
The deceased’s father, Suresh Mishra, a resident of Central Avenue, moved the forum citing deficiency in service leading to medical negligence on June 6, 2008. Mishra held Shanti Mohan Hospital, its proprietor Dr Sanjay Jain, medical officer Dr YR Jain and visiting consultant Dr Y Balsubramanyam responsible for Payal’s death.
In its final order passed on March 15, the forum ordered all the four respondents to pay (individually or collectively) Rs2.70 lakh with 10% interest towards medical expenses from June 5, 2008, the date of filing complaint, a cost of Rs10 lakh in damages and Rs30,000 for legal expenses to Mishra.
In his petition, Payal’s father alleged that the three doctors admitted her claiming she was suffering from tuberculosis and started the treatment on June 9, 2007. Investigations proved she was not a TB patient. Meanwhile, her condition deteriorated forcing the family to shift Payal to Care Hospital on June 14. Care doctors told the family Payal was suffering from cardiac encephalopathy disorder which led to her death on June 24 while undergoing treatment in ICU.
Accusing Shanti Mohan Hospital and the three doctors of deficiency in service, Mishra complained that despite spending lakhs of rupees, his daughter couldn’t saved. He demanded Rs15 lakh in compensation stating that Payal was a brilliant student and well-placed in a private firm earning a handsome salary.
The respondents denied all the charges levelled against them on the basis that Payal was never treated or diagnosed for TB under their care at the hospital.
Talking to TOI, Dr Sanjay Jain said he had never examined Payal. His name was dragged in the case solely because he owned the hospital, Jain said.
Dr Balsubramnyam, who had referred Payal to Shanti Mohan Hospital, had examined her at his clinic on Central Avenue in the afternoon the day she was admitted. “We never treated her for TB as claimed in the petition. She had come with abdominal pain and complained of irregular cycles,” he said.
Dr Balsubramnyam said Payal had left the hospital on foot after discharge against medical advice. “As per our investigation, she was suffering from anaemia and had water had filled near her heart,” he said.
Rejecting the doctors arguments, the forum pointed out that as per her death certificate, it is evident that the patient passed away due to cardiac arrest. “But in the papers provided by Shanti Mohan Hospital, there is no mention of cardiac problem. If proper treatment for heart problems was done, her condition may not have worsened,” it said, holding the respondents guilty for her untimely death."

Bifurcated AP has a population of 5.30 crore, where in 3,93,45,717 are registered voters, of which 1.99 crore women voters. Around 94 lakh women are a part of the eight lakh self-help groups across the state. Though the SHG movement in India started in 1980, it strengthened during the late CM NTR’s tenure in the state.
In almost all 13 districts women voters are more in number compared to male voters. So, the main political parties are targeting women voters, especially the SHG who can influence the other voters in their surrounding localities and colonies.
Keeping this in mind, the ruling TDP has given sops in the name of Pasupu Kumkuma and a financial assistance of Rs 21,116 crore in the past four years. Meanwhile, the YSRC has been promising SHGs more benefits than TDP.
Local leaders and the contesting candidates of particular segments are urging SHG leaders to support them in exchange for help to the SHG for many welfare schemes. The candidates of various parties are meeting the heads of SHGs and SHG federations’ leaders in the cities.
Cities such as Visakhapatnam, Vijayawada, Tirupati, Rajahmundry, Nellore, Guntur, Ongole, Chittoor and Kakinada, besides others have thousands of groups, while each district has an approximate 40,000 groups to 80,000 groups.
“In some areas, few SHGs have been participating in the campaigning processes of the political parties. But majority of the SHGs are keeping their cards close their chest. Nobody can assess their mandate,” said one of the official of Urban Community Development (UCD) wing.

“Around 80% of the SHGs are under the eligible category of taking loans Rs 3 lakh which is now approaching towards Rs 5 lakh loan eligibility. That means all these groups are active.

The meeting was chaired by NCP leader Ajit Pawar and Congress leader Prithviraj Chavan.
The party is hoping for a swing in votes. The party gave a ticket to a loyalist to avoid division of votes and defection.
In the days before the candidate was announced, the Congress city unit workers had approached senior leaders in Delhi demanding that it pick a candidate from the party instead of an “outsider”.
The party's senior leaders from the city had written to party chief Rahul Gandhi to avoid an ""imported"" candidate in Pune."

Preliminary investigations revealed that the girl killed herself as she harboured one-sided feelings for a youth. Police have recovered a suicide note in which the girl has blamed two youths for the extreme step. A case of unnatural death and abetment to suicide has been registered.
Buddha Ram, CI, Kotwali Sirohi, told TOI, “On Monday night, the girl was studying in her room. When the parents went to check on her, the room was locked from inside. After many attempts to unlock the door, they realised that something was wrong and informed the police. When we broke down the door, we found the girl had hung herself from the ceiling fan.”
In the suicide note, allegedly written by the girl, who was to turn 18 in September, two youths were named. “The suicide note named two youths who at the time of suicide were in Udaipur. The girl had feelings for one of them, while the other was his friend. We spoke to one of them and he informed us that he had told the girl to stay away from him and even has screenshots of their conversations as well as recordings. One of the youths had also spoken to the girl’s father regarding this situation. We have asked them to return from Udaipur for further questioning,” added the CI.

“We gave money in the very first year for the new capital city, but not a single permanent structure has come up there. Claims are being made that the central government is not giving money for the new city. The few temporary structures in Amaravati have been built at a cost of Rs 10,000 per sq ft,” Goyal claimed, adding that he was asking the AP government to give an account of the money given by the Centre “because nobody will believe that a temporary structure will cost Rs 10,000 per sq ft”.
“I challenge Naidu to a debate on all these issues. I have invited him to Delhi on a date and time of his choice because Telugu people all over India and all over the world want to know the truth. I will expose all the falsehoods that he has sought to project in the debate,” he said. He further alleged that Naidu was running the government like a “private family firm”, and people will wind up this firm on April 11 (election day). “This government is focused on the welfare of one family. I am told there are four candidates from that (Naidu’s) family fighting in this election,” he said.
He also dismissed Naidu’s claims that Centre was not providing funds for Polavaram project. “It’s a big lie. A falsehood is being spread that the central government is not providing funds, whereas the reality is that Polavaram has been declared a national project, and between Rs 6,000-Rs 7,000 crore has already been given to the state,” Goyal claimed.
He also ridiculed the poll manifesto released by the Congress on Tuesday. “It’s full of falsehoods. It is a ‘sheikh chilli’ manifesto. It is a manifesto of a mirage which never exists. They have talked only of spending large amounts of money but have no clue how that money is going to come,” Goyal said."

Rushikant even sent a picture of the two daughters hanging from the noose to his wife, who had eloped with her paramour a week earlier.
Sources said Rushikant, a resident of Vivekanand Ward in Ballarpur, was working as a teacher in a private ITI and had two daughters. His wife Pratibha (name changed) allegedly had an affair with a driver living in the same area. She had apparently eloped with him a week back, leaving her husband and two daughters behind.
Rushikant and his family members tried to locate her, and convince her to return. However, Pratibha refused to return to her marital home. Rushikant had also filed a complaint with Ballarpur police about his wife going missing.
Police sources claimed Rushikant chocked his two daughters, Narayani (5) and Kartikeyi (2), to death with scarves and then hanged them. He then clicked pictures of their dead bodies in the noose and sent the photos on the WhatsApp number of his wife. He then went to another room and hanged himself.
On seeing the pictures of her dead daughters, Pratibha first informed her father, who lives at Warora, the same night. Her father then contacted Rushikant’s brother at Ballarpur, who rushed to his house in the wee hours of Tuesday.
When nobody opened the door after repeated knocking, he broke the door with the help of neighbours only to find the dead bodies of Rushikant and his two daughters. Police recovered the dead bodies from two separate rooms.

While the TDP candidate, M Sri Bharat, uses much of his time with electors at his road-shows and election rallies to speak about the purported achievements of his grandfather, the late MVVS Murthi, who last served as the LS member for Visakhapatnam in 1999-2004. Murthi, who died in a road accident in the United States in October last year, had served two times as LS member, the first time being in 1991-96.
The BJP candidate, D Purandeswari, has been using her election rallies and roadshows to highlight the infrastructure and industrial projects she had brought to the port city, when she had been MP from 2009-2014, on a Congress ticket. Purandeswari had also been a junior minister in the Manmohan Singh cabinet. The projects include making the city airport into an international destination, the merger of the ailing Bharat Heavy Plate and Vessels with BHEL, and the introduction of a Vistadome train between the city and Araku, a tourist attraction.
Purandeswari, who was deployed on the BJP ticket after the sitting member K Haribabu, declined to defend his seat, is also reportedly going slow in her campaign to give Sri Bharat—who is the younger son-in-law of her brother, Nandamuri Balakrishna, a film actor—a shot.
However, Sri Bharat’s father, MS Pattabhi Rama Rao, denied any covert arrangement with Purandeswari, saying, “Why will the BJP want to give up the seat it had in the 16th Lok Sabha?”
“The BJP is serious about winning the Visakhapatnam seat, going by the visit of the Prime Minister to address a rally on March 1 and the forthcoming visit by BJP president Amit Shah on April 4,” Rama Rao said.
The YSRC candidate, too, appears to be excelling at offering the rear-view mirror, with MVV Satyanarayana silently nodding his head when the party’s Muslim leaders were extolling the late YS Rajasekhara Reddy for approving a 4% reservation to the Muslim community in higher education in united Andhra Pradesh.
The Jana Sena candidate, VV Lakshminarayana, is hoping that his vaunted career in the IPS would give him an entrée with middle-class voters.
Voters are clearly left cold as candidates speak about their parties’ past achievements instead of setting out a forward-looking roadmap for the city. “An MP may not have a direct role in improving the water supply, healthcare and education in the city, but he can lobby with policy makers in Delhi and the state government for policies that will make life easier for the residents of Vizag,” says Mohnish Rao, a prominent resident and former president of the Visakhapatam Chamber of Commerce and Industry."

Felspar is a major raw material used in the production of ceramic tiles. The department took the decision on the recommendations of the industry department to protect the domestic industry.
According to sources there were about 3,500 mining quarries of felspar in the state. These quarries mainly cater to the ceramic units located in Gujarat.
At present, the grains, chips and gitti mined in Rajasthan are transported to Gujarat in its raw form and is processed into powder there before being supplied for industrial use.
This has affected about 3,000 domestic industries set up in the state and a large number of workforce engaged in this sector. Sources said the ban on the transport of felspar in raw form would help the domestic industries which could add value addition by processing it into powder and supply it to the industries directly.
This would not only generate additional revenue to the government in the form of GST besides generating more jobs to the youth and help the domestic industry to flourish, sources said.
Sources said the state government in October last year had restricted the transportation of felspar which had to a certain extent, helped the domestic industry. But it was only a partial move, it could not generate the desired effect.
So, the government has decided for a total ban. So now, with the ban, felspar can be exported only in the form of powder, which would be a boon for the industrial units in this sector, sources said."

The situation in the past three months is no different even as a new government in the state has come to power, dashing hopes of new jobs creation.
In the 11 months of the current financial year through February, RIICO’s land allotment came down to 106 acres from a recent high of 2,276 acre in 2016-17 and 152 acre in 2017-18.
Worse, the state public sector utility has not been able to acquire any land during the current year against a target of 900 acre. Similarly, it has also missed targets for developing land in its possession. It had planned to develop industrial areas of 2373 acre in the current year but till February, it has developed only 1153 acre.
TOI tried to reach top RIICO officials to understand the reasons behind the state PSU’s failure to meet its own targets for successive years but could not get a response. However, the business community in the state said that investors are not very keen to come to Rajasthan because of high land prices and bureaucratic hurdles.
“First, the land rates in neighbouring states Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh are lower than in Rajasthan. Even as the desert state has large parcels of infertile or semi fertile land, the government has raised their prices so high that the investors find no business case to buy land and set up industry here. Secondly, the bureaucracy and the system is a challenge that very few investors want to navigate,” said an industrialist preferring anonymity.
After the Congress government took over in December last year, the thrust has been on framing the industrial policy. RIICO had sent its officials to various states to study industrial policies and practices so that the best of the features can be incorporated.
But another industrialist said that the high prices of land is such an obvious factor impeding investment that it does not need deliberations lasting for months. “The quicker they take a decision, the better will be the situation,” he said."

They further alleged that the chief secretary, principal secretary for home and the DGP have given instructions to all intelligence wing officers to submit all reports related to the elections, especially reports related to other political parties, to Venkateswara Rao via WhatsApp.
The YSRC argued that the sharing of intelligence reports with Venkateswara Rao even after his transfer and the appointment of new director general, intelligence, violates the orders issued by the EC and is an example of how government machinery can be misused.

“In Bareilly, when kanwariyas used to sing bhajans earlier, they were attacked with lathis. However, in the Yogi government, flowers are showered on kanwariyas instead of lathis. The government also showered petals on pilgrims who participated in the Kumbh.

The 13-year-old is now world no. 1 in the under-14 girls’ section. She becomes the second Indian after Koneru Humpy to hold the rank.
Divya’s 2432 Elo rating also makes her No. 5 in the junior (U-20) category. She is the only Indian in the top 10 of this list. The achievement places her at No. 3 among Indian women. Ahead of her are the more experienced 31-year-old Humpy (2549 Elo) and 28-year-old Harika Dronavalli (2492 Elo).
“I had not expected both to happen so fast. I just hope I can maintain the rating and also go on to become No.1 as soon as possible. This isn’t the limit for me,” Divya told TOI.
Divya’s rise in the rating is very fast and she has done “pretty well in the last three months”, according to Humpy. “This is a very good sign for the country. After me, I think Divya is the only women player to have achieved this feat,” she told TOI.
A two-time world cadet chess champion, Divya became city’s first Women International Master (WIM) in 2018 and started the year with an Elo of 2168. In three months, she garnered 264 international rating points.
Following her maiden triumph in the open women category at the AICF International Round Robin tournament, Divya scored her first IM norm too. At the Aeroflot Open 2019, she missed the IM norm but cleared her second WGM norm and also touched a live rating of 2,400.
Divya’s consistent performance recently helped her go past senior Indian players like Soumya Swaminathan (2402), Tania Sachdev (2397), Eesha Karavade (2370), Padmini Rout (2364), R Vaishali (2353), Bhakti Kulkarni (2350) and Vijayalakshmi Subbaraman (2342) among others.
In October 2001, a 14-year-old Humpy had cleared the 2,400 mark to become the youngest Indian player ever to do so. Within a year she also became World’s youngest GM beating Judit Polgar's previous mark by three months. Humpy’s record was broken by Chinese Hou Yifan in 2008.
“It is a sign of fast improvement and her learning is in the right direction,” said Humpy of Divya touching the 2400 Elo mark.
“Crossing 2400 is very good as it also helps in getting the IM title. Otherwise, crossing the rating becomes more difficult than clearing norms,” said Divya.
While Divya broke Humpy’s record of achieving the 2400 Elo mark by some months, the 13-year-old has in her all the ingredients of becoming India’s youngest GM too. Humpy, however, has a word of caution for Divya. “Divya’s tough fight starts from here as her opponents will be more alert. She needs to work a lot to maintain the rating and should only think on how to improve further,” she said.
“I think maintaining the rating can be little tough and increasing it will be really difficult now. My initial aim is to become an IM and then as usual the GM title. But improving my game is my priority,” said Divya.
Divya, who recently became Maharashtra’s youngest Shiv Chhatrapati awardee with city’s Raunak Sadhwani, is currently participating as the 39th seed in the 21st Dubai Open."

The police pointed out that cricket betting, card games, and cockfights continue in Vijayawada despite a crackdown by police on gambling rackets. Racketeers are finding new ways and means to keep themselves off the police radar.
Cricket betting is one of the major gambling activities that has emerged in the past decade. Betting has spread far and wide after the Indian Premire League (IPL) was introduced. Betting networks can now be found in every corner of AP, and they are not limited to the IPL. Major cricket betting rackets were busted across the state last year.
This is reflected in state crime record bureau’s statistics at various police units. Cricket betting has been a major menace across the state for the past several years. The police units in other districts such as Guntur urban, Guntur rural, Kadapa and Vizag too have played a pivotal role by focusing on enforcement against it.
While officials claim that organised betting, which is conducted physically, saw a substantial decrease during this IPL season, there is a rise in the rackets running cricket betting online. Android applications are being used to run cricket betting and cops are struggling to trace them due to technological disadvantages.

Excerpts from the conversation:
Your first reaction after getting Congress ticket?
I thank the party leadership for reposing confidence in me. I will try to come up to their expectations taking everybody along in the party here. There were all sorts of speculations in the media and amongst people that I won’t get the ticket this time and that usually does happen. But it gave me no sleepless nights. For the last two months, I haven’t been to Delhi. I was confident somehow because of my work here and my connect with the people of the city, the party would repose that confidence in me.
How will you take along rival factions like that of Tewari and Sidhu group?
Firstly, I would like to rebut again as I did in the past. There is no rival group in Chandigarh Congress. All true congressmen in the city supported me. As far as Manish Tewari and Dr Navjot Sidhu is concerned, I suppose the final list of Punjab is not out yet. They are trying their best to win seats in Punjab. But I would seek support from all congressmen and Congress leaders from Punjab and Haryana including Manish Tewari and Dr Navjot Sidhu.
How will you woo the voters this time?
The failure of BJP has given the chance to the residents to compare the work done by me and sitting BJP MP in Chandigarh. People can compare work done under the UPA government and BJP government. The BJP government failed both at local and national level. The promises were made to residents but never fulfilled by the BJP.
Any message for your likely opponents in BJP.
It’s only after the candidate selected by BJP, I would comment on it. But I would endeavour to set good and high standards of political discourse in the city. That would be my sincere endeavour.
Who do you think will be easy candidate in BJP for you to defeat?
This is something which is not within my command and reach. I never gave it a thought. I will decide the next course of action only after BJP decides its candidate. Given the BJP, whether it is A, B, C or anyone, they all belong to BJP. They will all be responsible of acts of omission and commission, and that baggage everybody will have to carry. I think people will prefer Congress this time.
Your opponents are planning to raise the Rail Gate scam. How will you tackle opponent's strategy?
If anyone who raises the Rail Gate scam, it will be either out of total ignorance, or out of total malice and mischief which I don’t think my opponents in BJP are. It is defamatory and I have proceeded against some people, I would see what appropriate action I have to take. I have not only got a clean chit but I am cited as prosecution witness in the case. The court had even dismissed an application moved by an NGO seeking re-investigation into the case, saying that the application is devoid of merits. The BJP leaders, who will raise this point, are masters in spreading misinformation."

Umang Shridhar and Abhishek Dubey have been named on the list for their start-ups while the publisher trio of Piyush Ghosh, Tannison Mathews and Tuhin Sen were listed for ‘The Optimist Citizen’.
Shridhar, founder of KhaDiGi a fabric supplier, is working for the welfare of artisans of Bundelkand by providing them congenial working atmosphere with better machinery and access to market. “This is a big achievement for me. Being from a village background, I saw the hardships of people and realized that their talent was not being recognised. When I graduated, I wanted to do something for them to improve their conditions,” she said.
Founder of Muskaan Dreams, Dubey is trying to improve the level of education in government schools so that children coming from a humble background can also get good education like those studying in private schools.
“I grew up in a village of Madhya Pradesh and saw for myself that the state of government schools was pathetic. So, I wish to ensure that the coming generation does not have to go through what I experienced. I started designing techniques to digitalize classrooms in government schools for children from humble backgrounds, which led to the birth of my company,” he said.
The journal 'The Optimist Citizen’, which was co-founded by Ghosh and his friends Tuhin Sen and Tannison Matthews, highlighted positive development in the society. The journal aims to change the mindset of people by bringing them positive news from around the world.
Know these entrepreneurs
Umang Shridhar - Coming from the nondescript Kishunganj, a small village in the Bundelkhand, Shridhar wanted to do something for the underpaid artisans of the region. After completing BCom (Honours) from Delhi University, she realized the need for a business-to-business model to improve the condition of the artisans and recognize their talents. KhaDiGi, a fabric supplier platform, was founded in 2017, after a lot of ground research. The firm started as a means to empower women by teaching them how to weave and spin ‘khadi’ cloth and then expanded to give a platform and market to the local artisans.
“I had seen that the working conditions and wages for the local weavers, artisans, dyers, spinners was very poor. After completing my graduation, I enrolled in NIFT to study textile designing. I spent two more years researching about the needs and problems of artisans and then developed a B2B model to make and sell fabric to big textile companies. The model is made taking into account the needs of the local artisans, and not for the sake of profit alone,” she said.
Abhishek Dubey - Hailing from Gwalior, the co-founder of Muskaan Dreams, which works to improve the infrastructure and digitalize government schools, is working to ensure that children studying in government schools also get the same facilities that private school children get. “I used to notice that government schools did not have proper infrastructure or teachers. And even if the students wanted to study, they did not have the resources,” said Dubey.
Dubey completed his Bachelors in Engineering and started working to teach kids in a shelter home. Muskaan Dreams was born in 2014 as an organization promoting education for the underprivileged. It later grew into a start-up to equip government schools with e-learning tools, digital infrastructure and provide training to teachers to operate the gadgets.
So far, the organization has digitalized 100 classrooms in seven schools of Gwalior, Indore and Bhopal, reaching more than 12,000 children and improving attendance and enrollment in government schools.
The Optimist Citizen - Co-founded by Piyush Ghosh, Tuhin Sen and Tannison Matthews of Bhopal, The Optimist Citizen is a monthly journal that brings positive news and developments to the readers. Established in late 2014, the monthly journal aims to change people's mindset by giving them something good to look forward to.
“My friends and I are avid readers and we read the newspaper daily. While we were in college, we used to be frustrated reading about murders, rapes and all kinds of scams in daily newspapers. It was then that we thought that people who are working to create change in society must also be given due credit and attention, which seemed lacking in the news back then. So the three of us started it as a volunteer project while we were in college and kept it alive even after we graduated,” said Ghosh.
The four-and-half-year-old journal is touching lives and slowly weeding out the negativity that creeps in due to negative news."

It was only four months ago that Shivakumar had helped his party wrest control of this Lok Sabha segment from the BJP.
The bad blood began last year when Shivakumar entered Belagavi politics by backing Laxmi Hebbalkar in the Belagavi Rural assembly constituency and her camp in the elections to a local co-operative bank. The Jarkiholi brothers from the Valmiki community — Ramesh, Satish, Balachandra, Lakhan and Bhimshi — have long regarded Belagavi as their exclusive political turf. Even though Ramesh and Satish are Congress members, the clan viewed Hebbalkar’s growing profile as a strategy by Shivakumar to gain a foothold in the region.
The coalition politics drama at this stage made matters worse as the Congress refused to offer cabinet berths to Satish and Ramesh, forcing the ouster of the eldest brother, and Shivakumar gained the upper hand in the Belagavi turf war.
The fallout is now visible in Ballari where a candidate with family ties to the Jarkiholis, Y Devendrappa, has entered the fray on a BJP ticket, challenging VS Ugrappa who is backed by Shivakumar. Devendrappa’s son is married to Jarkiholis’ sister.
The Ballari segment is reserved for the Scheduled Tribes. Shivakumar had helped the Congress win this segment in the November 2018 bypolls after 14 years, and he is currently the district in-charge minister for Ballari.
Shivakumar’s push in Belagavi has strained the Jarkiholi family’s links with the Congress. Ramesh, a sitting Congress MLA, has reportedly moved closer to the BJP, boosting the saffron party’s apparent efforts to topple the Congress-JD(S) government. Balachandra is already a member of the BJP.
Before fielding Devendrappa, the BJP leadership faced a dilemma in Ballari as the Reddy brothers and Valmiki strongman B Sreeramulu stepped aside. The party wanted Sreeramulu or his sister, J Shantha, an MP in 2009, to contest here, but they were not enthusiastic about the move after the BJP lost the bypoll to Congress by over 2 lakh votes. Moreover, Sreeramulu shifted his focus to Chitradurga. The Reddy brothers are staying away from the Lok Sabha campaign to sort out their legal troubles arising from allegations of illegal mining.
All this gave the Jarkiholi family an opportunity to launch a counterattack, through the BJP, in Shivakumar’s new territory, according to some political observers.
Shivakumar denied there was a proxy war and said relations alone cannot work in elections. “In politics, everyone is related to someone. I too have relations cutting across party lines, but that doesn’t guarantee a win. I don’t want to take anyone’s name or consider it a proxy war,” he said.
Congress working president and Bidar candidate B Eshwar Khandre hopes Ramesh won’t hurt the party’s chances in Ballari. “I’m still hoping Ramesh Jarkiholi is a Congressman,” he said."

When residents thought they had seen the worst of it - fumes visibly covering the entire plateau, making it difficult to breathe over the past few days - a massive fire broke out on Monday evening and couldn’t be doused even after more than four hours.
Three fire brigades, Goa police and ambulance services were seen on site with traffic diverted on the Taleigao slope through Adwalpalkar’s Horizon residence on the Taleigao road.
Residents who have been bearing the brunt of the toxic fumes for more than a week now, told TOI that after complaining to the panchayat, the problem has only aggravated.
“They told us the problem would be sorted out in a few day’s time, but the plastic dump has been burning more aggressively after that. The fact that this has been going on for so long and in broad daylight only proves their blatant disregard for the health and safety of the community. Those in power are simply not acting. Someone needs to be held accountable,” Mike Smith, a resident of the area told TOI, adding that the fumes have been entering his home on the seventh floor despite him shutting the doors and windows.
“I have developed a severe chest infection. Authorities don’t care about the amount of toxins being released into the air. People will face the brunt of the fumes in the years to come,” he said.
Local MLA Jennifer Monserrate said the fire at the dump began a few days ago outside the compound wall of the garbage site, and added that the contractor was not responsible for setting the fire. The dry waste that is collected is baled at the site and then sent to a cement factory, she said, adding that the solution is to set up a garbage treatment plant at the site.
Sarpanch Janu Rosario, when contacted, said the panchayat is looking at solving the problem.
Geetanjali Mehrotra, another resident said no solution has been forthcoming and added that she feels helpless with the ash settling on clothes drying in the balcony. “My three-year-old son has been falling ill. It breaks my heart to see him breathe the toxic air. We decided to bring him up here because we thought the air was pure,” she said.
Goa State Pollution Control Board chairman Ganesh Shetgaonkar said the board hadn’t received any complaint regarding the pollution as a result of burning of plastic, and added that he would look into the problem.
Earlier on Monday, workers were seen at the garbage dumping site physically sifting through and segregating glass bottles from the other dry waste, sans gloves or masks while a large pile of plastic waste was burning.
The National Green Tribunal has banned burning of waste in the open, and the pollution board after receiving complaints from residents hase fined a number of panchayats in the past, including Taleigao panchayat."

In his compliant to district superintendent of police (SP) Deepa Ganigar, Thangata alias Senthil said he had questioned PMK candidate Anbumani Ramadoss about the latter’s ‘absence’ in the constituency for the past five years and his stand against the eight-lane road project between Salem and Chennai when the central and state governments had brought it. “Suddenly, Semmalai, who was standing next to Anbumani, slapped me on my face.”

The court asked the top bureaucrat as to how many such law officers were employed in government departments with questionable credentials.
K Karmegam, an advocate, in his petition sought action against the Madurai corporation’s law officer on the grounds that she obtained the law degree when she was a fulltime employee with the corporation, drawing salary. The petitioner pointed out that this was against the mandate of the bar council. According to the petition, the corporation law officer obtained the law degree from Karnataka law university. She had joined the Madurai corporation in 1992 as a nursing orderly and was posted as a typist in 1994 after which she got admission in a law college in Karnataka and completed the course in 2000, without attending classes regularly.
The petitioner stated that the officer, who was a full-time employee of the Madurai corporation, could not have attended classes and drawn full salary and hence the degree obtained by her was illegal. According to the petitioner, the corporation had taken a different stand in admitting the degree of a person who pursued the course in correspondence without the corporation’s permission, but has made an exception in the present law officer’s case. The petitioner sought an interim direction restraining the present law officer from continuing in the position and also sought action against the college and university for granting the law degree to a fulltime employee drawing government salary."

On Tuesday, party president Pandurang ‘Deepak’ Dhavalikar told TOI that by April 8, MGP would take a call on which candidates it would support in the parliamentary elections as well as in the Mandrem and Mapusa bypolls. Political observers said the the state’s oldest regional outfit is likely to back independent candidate Jit Arolkar in Mandrem and Congress candidate Sudhir Kandolkar in Mapusa, which will result in BJP having to put in extra effort to wrest control.
Former deputy chief minister Ramkrishna ‘Sudin’ Dhavalikar told reporters that MGP had decided to pull out of the parliamentary polls after it realised that it would not be able to reach out to voters in all 40 constituencies. “That’s the reason former MLA Naresh Sawal and I advised the central committee against contesting the Lok Sabha elections,” he said.
He, however, exuded confidence that the regional party would win the Shiroda seat by a huge margin.

Reiterating the current power structure in the national capital where the lieutenant governor acts on the advice of the elected government on all issues except land, police and public order, Congress said in the manifesto that it will amend the Government of NCT of Delhi Act, 1991, to remove ambiguities. This was under the ‘Federalism and Centre-State relations’ section of the manifesto.

The party, however, said that it will give full statehood to Puducherry, a small Union territory on the southern coast which is also a half-state with a legislative assembly similar to Delhi.
The Congress dispensation in Puducherry finds itself stuck in a situation similar to Delhi and has been at loggerheads with the lieutenant governor there, accusing him of not allowing the elected government to function. In Delhi, the AAP government has often expressed its frustration of its proposals and schemes being vetoed by the Centre or put on the back-burner as the national capital lacks the status of the full-fledged state. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has also said that the elected government does not even have the power to hire a peon.
While the Congress has promised to amend the law of 1991, a constitutional bench of the Supreme Court had in its July 2018 order laid down a similar provision. The AAP government has been sending the files of new proposals and schemes to the LG after implementing them on the ground. The LG, however, continues to enjoy the undiluted power and control over Delhi Police, matters related to public order and land.
Though former chief minister Sheila Dikshit has often said that she had enjoyed a cordial relationship with the Centre during her three terms, the manifesto gives enough indication that the Congress government in Delhi too had confrontations with the LG and clarity on the power structure was important for smooth Centre-state relations.
The issue of giving Delhi the status of a full-fledged state has made it to Congress manifestos in the past, but despite appointing committees to examine the proposal, it could not move ahead on it. While Dikshit did not comment on the issue on Tuesday, she had earlier told TOI that during the Congress rule of 15 years in Delhi, she had tried for full statehood but could not achieve it. In an interaction last week, Dikshit had clearly said that the issue of full statehood was irrelevant in the coming General Election and the party won’t include it in the manifesto.
The Congress has also promised to prevail upon the states to implement the 73rd and 74th constitutional amendments, which talk about devolution of funds and functions upon municipalities directly from the Centre. This will strengthen the municipalities vis-à-vis the state governments and will also give them the power to do planning, which is currently enjoyed in Delhi by Delhi Development Authority."

The argument reached such an extent that Greater Kailash MLA Saurabh Bharadwaj dared Chandni Chowk legislator Alka Lamba to join Congress. In response, Lamba hit back saying: “Why are you impatient. Some people have already gone. Some will not go so easily.” She was indirectly referring to several AAP leaders who have quit the party over the years.
The sparring began when Lamba wondered on Twitter how AAP and Congress would form an alliance when the latter hadn’t included the former’s main poll plank in its manifesto. “Every party has its own election manifesto. Congress manifesto promises full statehood to Puducherry but it is silent on Delhi. This makes it clear that full statehood for Delhi is not an issue for Congress. AAP is making statehood its main issue. How will an alliance be formed?” Lamba posted.
Her comment invited a sharp reaction from Bharadwaj, who quoting Lamba’s tweet stated on Twitter: “What do you want? Full statehood or ……”
Unable to digest this, Lamba reverted: “How does what I want make a difference… anyway the time to ask this question is over… now the people of Delhi will decide.”
However, the exchange of words didn’t stop at that. Bharadwaj replied: “The public should know what their leader wants, only then the public will take a decision about their leader.”
At this, Lamba reverted: “My public knows me well. In 2020 (when Delhi assembly election will take place) I will inform the public of my five years works and my thoughts. Secondly, my thoughts are contrary to yours. More than the public, a leader should know the thoughts and wishes of the public. The leader should not impose (themselves) on the public.”
Bharadwaj then asked what people in Lamba’s constituency wanted. “The public wants education, health, water, electricity, pollution-free Delhi, corruption-free system, security and respect. With all these they also want their leader to stand with them in moments of happiness and sorrow. They want that their leader does not make a promise which he cannot keep. The public has already been cheated, they do not want more betrayal,” she responded.
The remarks were seen in indirect reference to Lamba’s recent remark that “there is no internal democracy in AAP.”
Adding fuel to the fire, Bharadwaj also shared a video in which Lamba was seen slamming Congress and BJP over full statehood. Lamba pointed out that the AAP leadership didn’t consult people before deciding to seek an alliance with Congress. This prompted Bharadwaj to ask when is she going to ask people whether she should join Congress or not.
Lamba then announced that at 3pm on Wednesday at Jama Masjid she will ask people whether she should join Congress or not. Bharadwaj then told Lamba not to back out and said he will also participate in the meeting."

It’s their ardent belief that Dambab plays gulal with Madgaonkars on this auspicious day.
It was a riot of colours amid a sea of revelers as “Zambaulecho Gulal” got under way. Cries of ‘Shree Ramnath Damodar Maharaj ki Jai!’ and ‘Har Har Mahadev’ rent the air as devotees flung fistfuls of gulal at the ‘palkhi’ carrying the idol of Lord Damodar stationed in the courtyard of Shree Ramnath Devasthan. Within seconds a cloud of red enveloped the landscape.
History has it that the original temple of Lord Damodar was located in the area known as ‘Madd’ in Margao, which is now referred to as Lingakadden and where the ancient temple tank still stands. During the time of the early conquests by the Portuguese in the 16th century, locals attempted to shift the Shivling to a safer place, but only managed to sever a part of it which they shifted to Zambaulim where the current temple of Shree Damodar stands. It’s in gratitude to Shree Ramnath that Dambab’s palkhi is brought to the temple the night before gulal.
The week-long Shishirotsav at Zambaulim began with the arrival of the traditional nal’l (holy coconut) from the house of late Purushottam Keni in Comba, Margao, to Damodar temple, Zambaulim, in a procession, on Thursday. Dhulpeth is celebrated the day after gulal, which is famous for the sumptuous meals served to devotees. The shigmotsav culminates with the immersion of the nal’l into the river."

But when the vice-captain fails miserably, fans would wish that the game was better not played. The scenario was no different when the ‘vice-captain’ of Desiya Murpokku Dravida Kazhagam (DMDK) Vijaya Prabakaran tried to don the jersey of his father and DMDK founder Vijayakanth, fondly addressed as Captain, at an election campaign at Trichy on Tuesday. Except for the party flags installed in the venue and blaring songs praising the DMDK founder, there was no similarity between the campaigns of DMDK’s captain and vice-captain.
Vijayakanth had two innings as a politician, the one before 2016 which was illustrious and established him as an aggressive politician who took on the two Dravidian giants. The other innings he played post-2016 saw him mostly babbling with funny reactions which lent themselves to meme-making material. His son Vijaya Prabakaran, a 28-year-old architect and owner of Badminton sports club, displayed no shades of either of his father’s innings. Vijaya Prabakaran arrived at the venue late by which time DMDK’s Trichy LS candidate was ‘missing’ and his cadres seemed restless. “Had it been Captain, the candidate would have stayed put even if it took hours for him to reach,” a DMDK sympathiser said concealing his disappointment.
“We cannot expect him to speak and connect with us like his father. If not for his father, he would have been nowhere near the position he enjoys. Premalatha Vijayakanth articulates well with her extempore speech,” T Parthasarathy, a resident of Palakkarai said while passing time at Eda Street. Out of the 30 minutes halting time of DMDK’s campaign vehicle, his elder son spoke for hardly 8 minutes while the candidate, Dr V Elangovan, and tourism minister Vellamandi N Natarajan accounted for the rest of the time. Forgetting the leaders of his own party, a major portion of the AIADMK minister’s speech was devoted to praising Narendra Modi
The vice-captain’s speech was neither aggressive nor enthusiastic with the listeners engaged in their own individual pursuits. “He looks similar to his father when he was young. His speech will improve over a period of time,” said S Kumar, a DMDK cadre from Gandhi Market. At one point, tourism minister Vellamandi N Natarajan who was standing along with Vijaya Prabakaran signalled the cadres to clap when the vice-captain was unsuccessfully trying to be sarcastic. Suffice it to say that the DMDK vice-captain, who is reckoned as the fourth star speaker of DMDK after his maternal uncle L K Sudheesh, failed to do justice to the importance the party bestows on him and did not emotionally bond with the cadres as Captain does."

Earlier, Stalin had described chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami as earthworm. Acknowledging it, EPS had said earthworm was a friend of farmer and make the soil fertile. In a counter-attack, Stalin called the chief minister a venomous worm.
Assuring that he would launch a probe into the death of former chief minister J Jayalalithaa once DMK forms the government in the state, he said, “I am confident that DMK will form government in the state and will bring several welfare schemes for the public.

Responding to fisheries minister D Jayakumar who questioned the intension of the probe, Stalin said he was speaking about the woman who was elected by the people as chief minister and it is his responsibility as an opposition leader to raise question when something wrong happened to the chief minister.
“It is deputy chief minister O Panneerselvam who first suspected the death of Jayalalithaa and demanded a probe. It is he who wanted the health minister Vijayabaskar to resign from his post. But, he forgot everything and became silent after he became deputy chief minister,” he added.

Though the elections were deferred citing litigation and administrative reasons, residents say they have been paying a heavy price as their demands for basic amenities have been left unaddressed.
The recent public dissent shown against AIADMK MLA and minister S Valarmathi while campaigning at Sevanthiyanipatti hamlet near Srirangam on March 29 was the outcome of this utter neglect, residents said. Poor focus and delayed solutions for a myriad civic issues including potable water supply and motorable roads have been making life difficult for a section of rural residents. Unlike in the urban local bodies, villagers say the absence of elected councils had robbed panchayats of funds and workforce to get works done. For instance, residents of panchayats situated close to the Trichy corporation limits badly miss their councillors and presidents who used to take their demands to the local body.
“Even for a minor grievance like a blockage in drinking water pipeline, panchayat officials take days to rectify. The lapses in ensuring basic amenities are being blamed on the state government which will contribute to the anti-incumbency,” R Kathan, a retired health inspector from Kumbakudi panchayat near Trichy said. While the ruling dispensation would bear the direct impact of this anti-incumbency feeling among villagers, the opposition too may not benefit much as people feel that its representatives had been maintaining silence on the issue of holding civic elections.
The elected representatives in rural local bodies acted as a bridge between residents and the authorities but with MLAs refusing to take up the responsibilities, these people have been left in the lurch. The special officer appointed by the state government has to cover about 20 village panchayats and hence expressed their inability to fulfil their demands. “People are loathing us every time they raise a complaint. They don’t understand our constraints and are upset with our services,” an official source in panchayats department said."

In a surprise move, the party has reportedly decided to field leader of the opposition in the state assembly and Amreli MLA Paresh Dhanani for the Amreli Lok Sabha seat. The party has also reportedly zeroed in on two more sitting MLAs for Lok Sabha tickets.
The party has reportedly told all these candidates to have their papers ready for a last-minute nomination, in order to avoid factional rifts due to disappointed ticket hopefuls. However, no official list was declared by the Congress till late on Tuesday night. However, mediapersons were told about the developments informally.
The Congress has reportedly decided to field Gandhinagar North MLA C J Chavda against BJP president Amit Shah on the Gandhinagar Lok Sabha seat. Chavda is a former GAS cadre officer and has long experience as an MLA. He is a popular orator in the Congress.
While many local Congress leaders in Amreli district have resigned and joined the BJP citing their unhappiness with Dhanani’s leadership style, the Congress decided to field him due to his popularity among the masses. Dhanani has in the past defeated BJP stalwarts such as current Union minister Parshotam Rupala, former Gujarat agriculture minister Dilip Sanghani and Bavku Unghad. The current MLA from Lathi, former MP Virji Thumar, had also demanded the Amreli ticket. Sources said the Congress president suggested Dhanani’s name for Amreli considering his “winnability”.
From the Surendranagar Lok Sabha seat, the Congress is said to have decided to give the ticket to Limbdi MLA and former MP from the seat Soma Ganda Patel (Koli). Somabhai was called and told to file his nomination. Somabhai will be up against BJP first-timer Dr Mahendra Munjapara. Both come from the Koli community.
On the Jamnagar seat, against BJP MP Poonam Madam, the Congress will field Mulu Kandoriya, who is also from the Ahir community like Madam. Kandoriya has a good following in rural areas of the constituency.
Of the 18 candidates the Congress has nominated so far, seven are sitting MLAs.

There is a big chunk of society which still needs to be educated, from social workers to teachers to even paediatricians. People need to know that autism is not mental retardness, it’s a behavioural disorder that affects social skills,” he said.
Patil spoke about how early detection can help manage autism to a great extent. “Autistic children show early signs from the age of 6-9 months. If paediatricians are able to detect the signs within 30 months, there are interdisciplinary therapies through which autism can be managed,” said Patil.
Earlier, ‘Walk for autism’ rally was taken out from Sarvoday Ashram, Amravati Road. Over 120 students, parents and a few doctors participated in the rally with the aim of spreading awareness on the issues circling autism.

Hema, who was touring her constituency on Tuesday, arrived in Ajhai Khurd village at around 11:30 am and addressed the meeting in the school premises where crowds had gathered in advance. People of the village say that for the entertainment of the crowd, organizers had roped in dance performers, whose moves were vulgar.
Talking to reporters, principal of the school, Sarla Devi Sharma, said that the public meeting was organised without permission from the authorities. “When we came to school in the morning, a tent had been pitched there and public gathered. It was like occupying the school forcefully,” Sharma said, adding that when she raised the issue, she was told that there would not be any trouble to the school and students.
Sharma said that she had to close her school after the mid-day meals as there was no point of teaching students while such loud music was being played nearby. She said the organisers had told her that the meeting would finish in two hours. She also claimed that she had to intervene to stop the “obscene” dance performances. “With young children (6-14 years) studying in the school, the dance performance was absolutely undesirable”.

Volunteers and party workers mill around the place sporting caps and scarves bearing the colours and symbol of the party. A group of workers who belong to NCP, a Congress alliance partner, are also chipping in. Patole had contested last election from Bhandara-Gondia constituency on a BJP ticket but later resigned and quit the party.
Patole’s day is planned to begin with a padyatra that starts around 8am. “More than 2,000 people voluntarily joined the march in North Nagpur today,” said Vikas Thakre, president of District Congress Committee. “Over the last three years, I have built the organization at the local level. To plan the campaign. Eighteen block presidents and 38 booth level presidents and heads of various committees meet at our office everyday,” Thakre adds. “The entire local Congress machinery is behind our candidate,” he adds.
Since Patole is also the chairman of All India Kisan Congress, a few members of the Kisan cell have also parked themselves in the city. “He is representing farmers and has stood up for their rights and so he is known all across the country,” says Priya Grewal, who has come from Delhi.
Door-to-door contact programmes, street corner meetings and rallies are organized for Patole every day. Women volunteers who are not party workers are also present in the office expressing their willingness to campaign for the leader. “Patole has a clean image and people are connecting with him on their own.

He said Neha had told him that some people in the office were desperate to get her transferred out and wanted to grab her position.
“I want an honest probe in the case. They are people who have a lot of power in the system. The sequence of events show that some powerful people are involved in the incident. The racket could be drug mafia, it could be the department. You cannot overrule anything without being investigated. There are various facts which have to be verified,” he said.

Pawar said Modi had violated the oath taken while being sworn in as the nation’s prime minister by his manner of ignoring groups that make for the diversity of India.
Pawar was addressing workers of all parties of the Maha Aghadi led by Congress and NCP. At the Monday rally at Wardha, Modi criticised the Gandhi family and attacked Pawar alleging that his nephew is snatching away the party from his uncle.
In a 40-minute speech, Pawar said, “I have seen and worked with many prime ministers. None of them has attacked chief ministers, even those belonging to other parties. Modi goes to West Bengal and criticises Mamata Banerjee, he goes to Hyderabad and Kerala and criticises chief ministers of those states. This does not suit the dignity of the office he holds. He criticises the Nehru and Gandhi family. He has forgotten the sacrifices of our freedom fighters and of Gandhi family members. I don’t know why he criticised me and my family. Ajit Pawar is a cultured person and a good administrator. We in the Pawar family offer some values while raising our young ones, and they are brought up to give back to society. The attack on Nehru or the Gandhi family is because of the ideology these represent, that Modi hates.”
Pawar also offered an assurance to the prime minster, saying he had no cause for worry on account of the NCP. “The NCP is not a party of just one person. It is the party of workers and Modi should not worry about our party.”
Pawar said Modi’s allegation that Congress demeaned Hindus was to be condemned. “Modi’s speech was all about Hindus. He has taken an oath delivered by the President of India that he will work for all sections of society. Are Muslims, Buddhists, Christians not part of India? Have they not sacrificed for India’s freedom? Modi thinks nothing of violating the oath taken on the Constitution. Such a person does not deserve to hold the office of prime minister,” Pawar said, appealing to workers to ensure that the alliance wins both seats, Kolhapur and Hatkanangale.
Pawar reminded party workers that Raju Shetti, MP of Hatkanangale, quit the alliance with BJP after he found Modi’s policies anti-farmer. Shetti is now with the Maha Aghadi."

This is the first time Patil has stayed away during a visit to the city by Pawar. Patil is currently campaigning against NCP candidate Dhananjay Mahadik. Patil is also unhappy with NCP leadership for inducting his father and long-time Congressman DY Patil into the NCP. Patil reportedly considers this to be an attempt to create a rift between his father and himself.
An aide of Patil, requesting anonymity, told TOI, “He was not in the city the whole day. We got the invitation to attend the meeting of workers of all the parties of Maha Aghadi. However we have taken the position not to cooperate with Mahadik. We are not against Pawar, we respect him. Our opposition is to the Mahadik family.”
Since the last two days after Pawar’s Tuesday meeting was fixed, messages from Satej Patil’s camp thronged social media accounts of his supporters. The posts read that Patil and his supporters are not against Pawar, but they will continue to oppose Mahadik. Patil had recently told district NCP head AY Patil that he felt betrayed after he was defeated by Mahadik in the assembly election even after he supported Mahadik in the last Lok Sabha election.
In the party workers meeting in the evening, district Congress president Prakash Awade said to Pawar that he was trying to carry out a ‘dressing’ on the wound caused by differences between Satej Patil and Mahadik. NCP leader and MLA Hasan Mushrif retorted that dressing alone would not suffice, a surgery might be needed."

Transfers of more than 50 doctors from the Sawai Man Singh Medical College to other medical colleges in the state have put the patients in a quandary.
“Inspections by the Medical Council of India (MCI) are scheduled in some medical colleges of the state. So the medical education department has transferred over 50 doctors from the SMS Medical College,” said a senior administration official from the college.
Five new medical colleges have come up in the state at Dungarpur, Pali, Bharatpur, Churu and Bhilwara. The academic sessions in these medical colleges started from 2018-19. “Every year, the MCI visits the new medical colleges for inspections to monitor that they are following the norms. The MCI team checks the number of doctors available as required in norms for a medical college,” said a doctor of professor rank, who has been transferred.
The medical education department is facing acute shortage of doctors for fulfilling the MCI norms across the state. Among the doctors who have been transferred include senior professors. These include specialists in medicine, pharmacology, biochemistry, radiology, orthopaedics and microbiology, among others.
Four orthopaedic specialists have been transferred from the SMS hospital, Jaipur, to the Government Medical College, Kota. The medical education department has proposed to MCI to increase MBBS seats in the Kota Medical College from 150 to 250. The medical education department has to show enough strength of doctors to fulfil the MCI norms.
For Dungarpur Medical College, the medical education department has transferred 10 doctors from SMS Hospital. Four doctors have been transferred from Kota to Dungarpur.
“Patients are facing difficulties due to mass transfers of doctors. A patient gets regular treatment from his specialist doctor and if that doctor is transferred, the patient is left in lurch. A doctor who provides treatment regularly to his patients understands their problems better.” The doctors who have been transferred are awaiting MCI inspection.

Most of the gold was recovered by DRI and the seizure of over 100kg of the metal from Mumbai has been hailed as one of the biggest gold seizure in the country. According to sources, the DRI officials who are checking the assets of Aliyar, a Dubai-based businessman, conducted inspections at various spots at Perumbavoor.

Sunil Gupta, a small-time trader of Chattarpur district was her third victim or husband, so to say.
The woman -- known as Sapna -- was arrested after the police busted the gang which was supplying brides in Bundelkhand. The area is notorious for its skewed sex ratio.
According to the police, Sunil Gupta, the trader from Kishangarh village of Chattarpur district, told Chandu, a local, about his desire to get married. Chandu and his accomplice Goloo -- both middlemen -- then introduced Sunil Gupta to Rahul, a resident of Sagar.
Investigating officer of the case Virendra Paraste said that Rahul promised Sunil a bride, but said the cost involved would be Rs 1 lakh. “They made a deal for Rs 95,000. While Rahul and Sapna divided Rs 50,000 among themselves, Rs 45,000 was divided between the other two,” police said.
Compared to the national sex ratio of 940 women per 1,000 men in the country, all districts of Bundelkhand in MP have sex ratio below the national average. Chhatarpur -- with an abysmally low sex ratio of 883 women to 1,000 men -- leads the lot. It is followed by Sagar (893), Tikamgarh (901) and Panna (914).
As it is difficult to get brides in the region, gangs and middlemen are active there. The gangs bring girls from Odisha to Bundelkhand for marriage.
“This has been going on for many years now,” the police said, adding, “many marriages last, but many people are cheated too.”
So Rahul from Sagar, who pretended to be Sapna's brother, introduced her to Sunil Gupta. “She is my sister and we belong to Chhattisgarh,” he told Sunil.
SHO of Kishangarh police station Paraste said, “The marriage was performed on March 4 and Rahul performed her kanyadaan. Rahul stayed with his ‘sister’ in her ‘sasural’ for a day on March 5. But on the morning of March 6 morning, they both went missing.”
Along with them, gold and silver jewellery worth about Rs 3 lakh was also missing, the police said."

“If there is stoppage for trains at Bharathapuzha station, passengers can use road transport to reach Shoranur junction which is one kilometre away. Land has already been acquired to construct a road from Shoranur junction to Bharathapuzha station,” said Gandhi Seva Vedi general secretary Prasad Shoranur.
However, officials of the Palakkad railway division said that since Bharathapuzha station was in the mainline, trains could not be operated from here. “That is why the railways closed down this station, and there is no scope for its revival now,” they said.
Bharathapuzha and Mankara railway stations were closed down due to operational loss as there were no enough passengers to travel from these stations.
The officials said that stops are provided for the five trains, which have skipped the Shoranur station, at Ottappalam and Vadakkancherry railway stations. Hence, passengers will not get affected.
They said there should be 400 to 500 passengers originating from a station daily to provide a stop for long-distance trains. The five trains did not have this minimum number of passengers. These trains had skipped the station to avoid congestion in the Shoranur station. This will help operate more trains and also MEMU services from Shoranur.
“There is demand for a Mangalore-Rameswaram and Ernakulam-Rameswaram train using the Palakkad-Pollachi new broad-gauge line though the Shoranur station,” the officials said.
Meanwhile, there was a proposal for a triangular station or bulb station at Shoranur Junction to connect it with Bharathapuzha station to avoid delay in changing engines at Shoranur. The proposal was to connect the adjacent railway stations of Shoranur, Bharathapuzha and Vallathol Nagar to turn the direction of trains coming from Thiruvananthapuram and Mangaluru side to Shoranur. This would facilitate engine reversal without changing the direction of the train. But the proposal was rejected by the railways in 2005.

Not only did theatres enjoy a great footfall, no one seemed to mind plonking themselves on rickety wooden chairs or the distractions caused by whirring ceiling fans. With multiplexes coming into the scene with their bouquet of luxury and the transition of cinema from celluloid to digital, single screens were hit hard. And since then, it has been all about theatres closing down, one after the other. After north Kolkata’s iconic theatre, Mitra cinema, downed shutters at the start of April, it sent ripples across Tollywood. Several members of the film fraternity talk about how to best handle the situation.
‘A joint appeal must be made to the govt’

The exhibitors, distributors and producers should have a constructive discussion and get to the root of the problem. One first needs to know why single screens are closing down one after the other. Is it the dearth of money or fewer films working in theatres? A joint appeal must be made to the government to resolve this crisis.

‘More theatres will shut if there’s not adequate return’

There are many issues plaguing single-screen theatres in Bengal. They are usually made on a huge plot of land and the latter, if exploited well, can bring them more money than the business of cinema. Cinema, like any other business, depends on returns on investment and more theatres will shut if there’s not adequate return. It’s a fact that the film industry in Bengal is dead and we need many things to revive it. One among them is government intervention. I have had discussions with many theatre owners and requested them to prepare a power point presentation on the things they will need. They have time till the election, as nothing can happen before it. After that, we have plans to show the presentation to financers and the government. Even if the land is developed into a multi-storeyed building or a shopping mall, it would be required to reserve space for two screens on one floor. Easy loan facilities for theatre owners can also help the situation.
— Prosenjit Chatterjee, actor

‘It’s a major cause of concern’

The audience today seeks basic comfort while watching a film — they want an AC theatre and comfy seats. Maintenance is a concern for single screens. I think theatre owners should rent out a portion for commercial usage and use that money for the hall’s upkeep. It used to be the same for Lighthouse and New Empire. If the audience is paying above `100 a ticket, they will demand luxury, and the theatre owners are not making enough money to provide that — it’s a catch 22 situation. The alarming rate at which theatres are shutting down is a major cause of concern.
— Atanu Ghosh, filmmaker

‘Single screen owners should be free to run films they want to’

I think single screens should be allowed to run films that are giving them business without the pressure of taking in more movies. So, a film should be allowed a fair run. The decision-making on the part of theatre owners has a role to play.
— Churni Ganguly, actor-filmmaker

‘Single screens are fast becoming a thing of the past’

We have to keep making movies that will bring money to the industry. It can’t be one, two or three filmmakers’ responsibility. I feel there’s a sense of insecurity that runs deep. In other industries, filmmakers and actors are created and people get worried when a film doesn’t work. I remember when Anuranan released, I went to check the film’s posters in Mitra, Star and other theatres in north Kolkata; it’s heartbreaking that single screens are fast becoming a thing of the past. We must take collective responsibility — let there be more actors and directors. Together, we sink or sail. There have been good films in Bengal too, but there can be more Gully Boys, Newtons or Badhaai Hos. There has to be a movement. If the audience makes it to theatres, the latter will survive, and we too will survive in the process. Cinema is a business and theatre owners need to take care of the electricity bills, staff salaries, upgradation, maintenance — we too must take responsibility of that. There was a time when Hindi songs were made from their Bengali counterparts and it was the same with films. I have watched Sairat at a Pune theatre and saw people giving ceetees. When I went for a Tamil film by Mani Ratnam, I saw people clapping at the names of the cast. One good director, one good film will not help the situation, films have to work in bulk.

‘Theatre owners need to focus on amenities’

The single screens that sustained offer the same comfort as plexes. People can buy food and access clean rest rooms. Gone are the days when one film would be given four shows at a single screen. Now, there’s a mixed bag of films — theatres offer Bengali, Hindi and English films. If the ticket prices are a bit cheaper than plexes, then the audience will spend the same money they saved on food. So, the theatre owners will need to focus on the amenities.
— Pratim D Gupta, filmmaker

‘Even bad films do good biz at multiplexes’

If single screens don’t run, commercial cinema will be the worst affected. Earlier, the theatre owners would charge a certain amount on tickets as service tax. After GST came into being, service charge was replaced with it. Now theatre owners, who would utilise that amount for the maintenance of halls, get nothing as the common reasoning is that the audience cannot be burdened more. This is taking a huge toll on single screens. All we want from the government is to give it to us in writing that if the theatres charge service charge, they won’t have a problem. We have had discussions on this and will again hold talks with government representatives after election. Since plexes offer comfort, even bad films do decent business there. But many single screens do not have the resources to offer the same comfort.

‘Making balanced films is the solution’

The state of Bengali cinema is despicable. Most films flop and the hits are few and far between. If films run, how can theatres shut shop? It’s only because films are failing to draw the crowds that theatres are hit so hard. There was a time when films by Tapan Sinha, Anjan Chowdhury, Sujit Guha, Tarun Majumdar, Haranath Chakraborty, Swapan Saha and me would run to packed theatres. My first film, Protidan, ran for 25 weeks. Lathi and Shwet Pathorer Thala were lapped up by the classes and masses alike. Now, the films that are lauded fail to garner good numbers and the movies that run are criticised by the audience. I think the solution to this would be making balanced films that make moolah and also touch the audience. In my time, a film would run on all three shows at a theatre and still complete 25 weeks. Today, if a film runs 100 days in one screen and has one show, it is considered big!
— Prabhat Roy, filmmaker


The revenue model at three single screens

“To run a film at Priya, one has to pay a rental of `1.75 lakh per week. If a film earns `5 lakh in the first week, `3.25 lakh goes to the distributor, who deducts his percentage and sends the rest to the producer,” said owner Arijit Dutta. The theatre offers many food and beverage options and that yields money as well.

Navina cinema is dependent on the exhibitor’s share of a film’s box-office collection. “For Hindi and English films in the first week, it’s a 50-50 share between distributor and exhibitor. For the second week, it’s 40-60 and from third week onwards, it’s 30-70. For Bengali films, the share is dependent on the understanding with the distributor and can vary. Unlike other theatres, mine allows the patrons to bring food, so the focus is not on the sale of food items,” said Navin Chokhani, proprietor of the theatre.


“Basusree cinema charges a rent in case of films they aren’t sure of. So, it’s Rs 50,000-60,000 in the first week for a film that has two shows. For four shows, the amount is `1.1 lakh. For big films, they opt for revenue sharing,” said Sourav Bose, one of the owners. The board of directors decide on rental/sharing on a case-to-case basis."

The film is now being remade in Tamil, and helming the remake is Saamy, known for his controversial films like Uyir and Sindhu Samaveli.

“During weekends, I make it a practice to show cartoon films to my kids. One day, they asked me why there aren’t any films for children that have human characters. So, I got them to watch Children Of Heaven. My sister, who had come visiting from our village, told me that these are the kind of films that should be made in Tamil. So, we bought the remake rights of the film and are adapting it for the Tamil audience,” begins Saamy, “This will be a 100 per cent ‘U’ certificate film for children.”


The movie, titled Akka Kuruvi, has been shot in Poomparai. “It’s about 20-odd km from Kodaikanal, and is by far the most beautiful village I’ve ever seen. Surrounded by lush green hills, there are just 1500 houses in that entire area. We’ve completed filming, and are looking to release it in May in Tamil, and also in Telugu,” he informs, and adds, “While I’ve stayed true to the original screenplay, I’ve added a few scenes to regionalise the content for our audience.” Maheen, Mollywood’s popular child artiste, and seven-year-old Daviya from Kannur play the lead roles.

But what is the significance of the title? “Akka kuruvi is a part of our folklore and refers to a kind of bird whose call sounds ‘akka’. One story is that two sisters came down to Cauvery for a bath and owing to aadi perukku, the elder sibling gets washed away. The younger one keeps calling out to her, saying ‘akka’, and takes the form of a bird. There’s another story that’s narrated by people in the Tirunelveli district. But the bottom-line is the love the siblings have for each other, and we thought no other title could justify this story,” he signs off."

It will be directed by A Venkatesh, who had worked with Prashanth in the hit 2001 film, Chocolate. “Prashanth will be seen as a tough guy who takes on local politicians who are involved in illegal activities. Anukreethy’s character is a fabulous one. We wanted a very pretty girl, someone who had a title like Miss India, and we are glad to have got her. She will be introduced as Miss India in the title credits,” he says.

The actor, who has already hosted some TV award shows and the finale of singing reality show, 'Sa Re Ga Ma Pa' in January is gearing up to host the upcoming season of dance reality show, 'Dance India Dance'.

Speculation about him hosting the show was rife for the past few days. The actor put all speculations to rest as he confirmed to us that he will be hosting the show and will start shooting for it next month. Without divulging too many details, he said, “What I got to know is that the show will be called 'Dance India Dance–Battle Of Champions'. All I know is that this time the show will be bigger than ever in its scale and grandeur, and it will be an all new concept with participants from all age groups.” Talking about his new hosting gig, he added, “I was recently approached by the producers for hosting it and I couldn’t have asked for a better opportunity. I have always said that through daily soaps, you get to be known as a character, and reality shows help you create your own identity. This was the chance I was looking for. It is too soon to say more, but I have already started preparing for the show and working on my looks.”

This, however, is not the case anymore. Thanks to the city’s growing cosmopolitan crowd and inclusive culture, audiences enjoy and appreciate Hindi theatre, just as much as Kannada and English. More alternative spaces have also translated into more shows, all of which is a welcome trend,” says veteran theatre personality Zafer Mohiuddin, whose latest Hindi directorial, Shaadi Ki Kirkiri, is premiering at Chowdiah Memorial Hall today.

Courtesy Bengaluru-based Kathputliyaan Theatre Group, the play is based on Sadiqa Peerbhoy’s book Marry Go Round. “The plot follows the life of Sartaj Jehan Begum, whose only goal in life is to bring home a ‘khaandaani bahu’. But her son, who stays abroad, has other plans, unfortunately. The play uses Hyderabad’s popular folk ‘dakhani’ humour and the city nostalgia-inducing nawabiyat,” says the director, adding, “Although it takes a satirical take on a typical household in the country, the play mainly aims at spreading the message of communal harmony through the arts.”


Shaadi Ki Kirkiri runs for a duration of two hours. The ensemble cast includes actors Imran Pasha, Vishal Gupta, Kousar Afgan, Maahir Mohiuddin, Aparna Jha, Shatarupa Bhattacharyya, Ashish Athavale, Ashok Dhariwal, Snehith Gowda, Suresh Sharma, Aparna Jha, Zulaikha Minnat, Amrita Mishra, Drishti Jain, Anshulika Kapoor, Srinivasa Naidu, Abhinav Vishwanathan, Aaqib Jamal, Mohit Somanna, Zara Samreen and Abdul Razak.

267,Sharanya CR,TNN,TNN,"Sourabh Raaj Jain: When I played Krishna, people said, ‘Why is our Krishna 6 feet 3 inches tall?","Sourabh Raaj Jain became a household name after he played Lord Krishna in 'Mahabharat', but along with the popularity came the risk of getting stereotyped. Most television actors, who became hugely popular on mythological shows, failed to break free from the mould, but not in the case of Sourabh. He has successfully managed to dabble in different roles within the mythological/historical genre, and is also looking forward to being a part of family dramas. So, how did he manage to do this? Read on...
You’ve played ‘God’ a number of times on TV. How does it feel?
Like they say, Ik Omkar, which means one God, various forms... I have had the opportunity to play various forms of God in my career. I have played Vishnu, Krishna and Mahadev on TV, and Lord Balaji in a Telugu movie with Nagarjuna sir. I feel blessed to have got these roles in my career, which actually started with a youth-based show (Remix) and regular fictional shows like Parichay and Uttaran, among others.


After becoming popular in the mythological genre, were you worried about getting stereotyped? How did you manage to break free from the Krishna image? We all have our fears, but it’s about how you take up the challenge. When I played Krishna, there were many who said, ‘Why is our Krishna 6 feet 3 inches tall?’ Some said, ‘Why isn’t Krishna darker?’ So, that was the challenge. After I played Krishna in 'Mahabharat', I was offered similar roles. People wanted me to make appearances at events as ‘Lord Krishna’, in that attire. But I followed my heart and declined all those offers. Breaking the mould was indeed a challenge. To break the monotony, I did a radio show, anchored shows like 'Savdhaan India', 'Bhakton Ki Bhakti Mein Shakti' and 'Mahapuran'. And then the show 'Mahakali — Anth Hi Aarambh Hai' came my way. No actor had played one God and then been accepted playing another one. Mahadev’s role was challenging and it had shades which I hadn’t explored earlier. Also, who had ever seen Mahadev with a beard and moustache? That may have looked odd to the viewer, who was used to a stereotypical image. Of course, the credit for being able to see me in these different avatars goes to the maker, Siddharth Kumar Tewary. What I’m currently playing (Dhananand in 'Chandragupta Maurya') is also something completely different. Who would have thought that after playing God, I would be playing the vicious and peculiar Dhananand? Stereotypes are challenges and I believe in taking challenges head on!

After 'Chandragupta Maurya', which is a historical, are you looking forward to doing a regular daily soap next?
I don’t slot genres according to soap, historical, mytho and crime. For me, the most important thing is my role. Yes, I would love to step outside the costume drama category and play a young urbanite, something closer to who I am.

As an actor, what is your biggest fear?
Stagnancy. I want to look forward to getting up every morning and going to work instead of finding an excuse or dreading going to work. Also, I never want to take up work just for the sake of money. I feel that when you are passionate about what you do, money will follow. If money becomes the primary factor, passion goes down the drain.

Did you always want to be an actor? How did it all begin?
It all began when Shrishtidi (producer Shrishti Arya) saw me with one of my friends, who had met her for the audition for her upcoming show, Remix. She asked me to audition as well, and in my excitement, I said whatever I could in front of the camera. Two months later, I was called to Mumbai from Delhi, where I was a second year computers application student. I never thought that I would become an actor, but after Remix wrapped up, I realised how much I missed acting and shifted my focus to it.

You have always said that your mother has had a huge role to play in shaping your personality...
I was raised solely by her for most part of my life. She studied, worked and raised me simultaneously. She has this never-give-up attitude and she has also inculcated a strong sense of right and wrong in me.

You got married quite early. When and how did you meet your wife?
There comes a point when you are certain that you have found the one you want to spend your entire life with. Luckily, I found Ridhima quite early in my life. I
met her in a dance class, which I had joined in a desperate attempt to learn some dancing. And since then, I am dancing to her tunes (laughs!)
You are a mamma’s boy and also a doting husband. How do you manage to strike a balance between the two most important women in your life?
Actually, I don’t need to balance anything, it’s my mom and Ridhima who balance everything for me. Maa and RidhiMaa, as I call them, gel well and that gives me immense relief and happiness, as my mother is very possessive about me.

How difficult is it for you to stay away from your one-and-a-half year old twins, given that the shoot of your show is in Umergaon?
At times, I wish that I had a teleportation machine! But since that is yet to become a reality, I try to meet them as much as I can. I sometimes travel to Mumbai or call them over to Umergaon.

Initially, you were an introvert. Has that changed in recent years?

I have worked hard on changing that. I’m opening up, considering how important that has become in current times.


Is Bollywood on your mind?

Good content is always on my mind, medium doesn’t matter. Having said that, any actor would love to see himself on 70 mm screen and I am no different.


Do you think film producers are right when they say that TV stars are over exposed because of their daily shows?

When I hear such things, I think of Amitabh Bachchan sir. His body of work and the fact that he is still doing so much is incomparable with anyone in any medium. So, does exposure because of daily soaps matter? In my opinion, no."

""Last time I came here with Bharti and we shopped a lot. I remember the prices of the suits were very high, and Bharti was continuously whispering in my ear, ‘tujhe dekh ke badha rahe hain price’. Ab mujhe toh pata nahi hai kaise milte hain suits. I have learnt the art of bargaining from my mom. Bahut seekha hai lekin bargaining ke liye bhi toh actual price pata hona chahiye tabhi toh insan bargain karega. But trust me, I love shopping for chikan suits for my mother from Lucknow.""

Moreover, I just don’t want to settle in life or become stable, I always want to do something different and unique because I think there is so much there for me to explore. Currently I can say I am happy with my career graph, jo chal raha hai it’s great, but at the same time you have to constantly push yourself to achieve your ultimate goals in life.""

Rithvik Dhanjani (BCCL/ Farhan Ahmad Siddiqui)

Talking about his plans of joining Bollywood, the actor shares that nothing interesting has come to him which can coax him to enter Bollywood. ""I am busy with a few projects in hand and then it becomes difficult for you to choose. There are certain things that you want to do and you even have time for it but woh kaam nahi hota jo apko karna hota hai. Yeh sab toh chalta hi rahta hai, but I want to explore as much I can,"" says he, adding, ""Actually I am waiting for some good scripts which should inspire me and andar se ek awaaz aaye ki yes boss this is right for you. I just don’t want to be a part of anything and everything. And mere saath problem yeh hai that there are a lot of things coming my way but I don’t want to be a part of them.""

271,M Suganth,TNN,TNN,Amrita Mahal Nakai: 'Kalank' is not one person’s effort; it requires an army of people to create something so grand,"The promos of Karan Johar’s upcoming magnum opus, 'Kalank '— set in the pre-Independence era — has already created a buzz. Now, the grandeur of the film’s set is also becoming one of the talking points. BT caught up with art director Amrita Mahal Nakai, the woman behind the design of the majestic set, to know more about it. Amrita credits director Abhishek Varman for giving specific instruction. She says, “We followed Abhishek’s vision and also, the script left no margin for error. We started working on the design around the end of 2016.”
The set showcases Hira Mandi — the famous market of Lahore — in all its glory. Amrita shares, “Our set of Hira Mandi is a rather fantastical version of Lahore in the 1940s, though we have retained the essence of the city as it was back then. We used a little bit of imagination and borrowed architecture from across the globe. Two designers — Anita Rajagopalan and Donald Reagan — were brought on board for this grand set as I was also working on another film at that time. Aparna Raina collaborated with me to design the set for the Chaudhry house and haveli.”


Talking about the colour palette used, she says, “We have shown restraint in the use of colours, so that it doesn’t look jarring. We have taken our liberties, but well within the canvas of the film. Red colour has been used extensively in Kalank. It’s a strong colour and is pretty much there in every frame of the film. We used various shades of it. Hira Mandi is the most vibrant of all the sets, so we used colours depicting the same.”

Talking about the nitty-gritties of the project, Amrita specifically mentions the pond and its hues. She shares, “We had a large tank of water, and I was clear that I didn’t want the water to look blue. That’s not the look I had in mind, as I am not a fan of blue. Also, that was not a part of the palette. At the same time, I didn’t want any other dark colour either. Another huge challenge was to keep the water clean during the 45-day schedule of the shoot. We devised a method through which the water looked green and we all loved it.”


But doesn’t working on such a large scale come with its own challenges? “Totally,” agrees Amrita, adding, “To make Abhishek’s vision real was a challenge. In today’s day and age, people are hardly putting up grand sets. They rely more on VFX to make sets look grand, but we built a set to give it a more real look. Of course, the makers will be using visual effects to enhance scenes, but we have kept it as real as possible. This would probably be the largest set I have ever designed.”


However, after all the hurdles, Amrita looks satisfied with the outcome of her effort. “This is not one person’s effort; it requires an army of people to execute something as grand as this. Working with Binod sir (Pradhan, cinematographer), who makes the frame look 20 times better, was phenomenal. That kind of sums up my journey in the film.”"

279,Supriya Sharma,TNN,Movies,Amrita Mahal Nakai: 'Kalank' is not one person’s effort; it requires an army of people to create something so grand,"The promos of Karan Johar’s upcoming magnum opus, 'Kalank '— set in the pre-Independence era — has already created a buzz. Now, the grandeur of the film’s set is also becoming one of the talking points. BT caught up with art director Amrita Mahal Nakai, the woman behind the design of the majestic set, to know more about it. Amrita credits director Abhishek Varman for giving specific instruction. She says, “We followed Abhishek’s vision and also, the script left no margin for error. We started working on the design around the end of 2016.”
The set showcases Hira Mandi — the famous market of Lahore — in all its glory. Amrita shares, “Our set of Hira Mandi is a rather fantastical version of Lahore in the 1940s, though we have retained the essence of the city as it was back then. We used a little bit of imagination and borrowed architecture from across the globe. Two designers — Anita Rajagopalan and Donald Reagan — were brought on board for this grand set as I was also working on another film at that time. Aparna Raina collaborated with me to design the set for the Chaudhry house and haveli.”


Talking about the colour palette used, she says, “We have shown restraint in the use of colours, so that it doesn’t look jarring. We have taken our liberties, but well within the canvas of the film. Red colour has been used extensively in Kalank. It’s a strong colour and is pretty much there in every frame of the film. We used various shades of it. Hira Mandi is the most vibrant of all the sets, so we used colours depicting the same.”

Talking about the nitty-gritties of the project, Amrita specifically mentions the pond and its hues. She shares, “We had a large tank of water, and I was clear that I didn’t want the water to look blue. That’s not the look I had in mind, as I am not a fan of blue. Also, that was not a part of the palette. At the same time, I didn’t want any other dark colour either. Another huge challenge was to keep the water clean during the 45-day schedule of the shoot. We devised a method through which the water looked green and we all loved it.”


But doesn’t working on such a large scale come with its own challenges? “Totally,” agrees Amrita, adding, “To make Abhishek’s vision real was a challenge. In today’s day and age, people are hardly putting up grand sets. They rely more on VFX to make sets look grand, but we built a set to give it a more real look. Of course, the makers will be using visual effects to enhance scenes, but we have kept it as real as possible. This would probably be the largest set I have ever designed.”


However, after all the hurdles, Amrita looks satisfied with the outcome of her effort. “This is not one person’s effort; it requires an army of people to execute something as grand as this. Working with Binod sir (Pradhan, cinematographer), who makes the frame look 20 times better, was phenomenal. That kind of sums up my journey in the film.”"

Looks like her wish has come true because she will be seen in Ajith’s Nerkonda Paarvai, albeit in a song.

A source in the know says, “Kalki has a special appearance in the film, and she will be seen in a rap number. It comes at a crucial stage in the script, and the song will also feature the lead cast, including Ajith and Shraddha Srinath. It’s an energetic number, and was shot sometime last month.”


Meanwhile, the shooting of the film, an official remake of the Bollywood hit Pink, was wrapped up in Hyderabad a week ago, and director Vinoth is presently busy with the post-production work. The source adds, “A few sequences have been added for Ajith and Vidya Balan in the Tamil version.

292,Debarati S Sen,TNN,Lifestyle,Ghibran to compose for Harish Kalyan’s next,"We all know that Sanjay Bharathi has turned director and will be making his first film with Harish Kalyan in the lead. With the pre-production work going on in full swing, it has now been confirmed that Ghibran has been roped in to compose music for the film. Touted to be comedy based on astrology, the film has been titled Dhanusu Raasi Neyargalae.

Says Sanjay, “We wanted something catchy, as well as something that goes well with the genre of the film. Astrology shows on television often use these lines, Dhanusu raasi neyargale or Kanni raasi neyargale. We chose Dhanusu Raasi... as it represents the arrow. People born in this rasi tend to have their targets right... something that works for the character I’ve written, too.”


Sanjay says that Ghibran’s music will be different. “I have always wanted to work with Ghibran. I love his style of music. Of late, he has been composing for a lot of thriller films. But for this film, the music will sound very different. It is a fun family entertainer, so the music, too, will echo that vibe,” he says.

The team will begin shooting for the movie from the end of this month in Chennai. PK Varma will crank the camera, Umesh is the art director and Gubendran will do the editing. As for the female lead, we hear that there will be two heroines and auditions are going on in full swing."

Having started her career on small screen, actress Anusha Rai is ready to transition to big screen. The actress, who currently features in the serial Rajakumari, will be seen in many movies including Karshanam, Mahanabavaru, BMW and Damayanthi. Family was hesitant

“Initially, my family members did not agree to the offers I got to act in serials. No one from my family had done that before, but they are very supportive now. I always discuss my projects with them before giving a final nod. Even my brother supports me in every step of my life, be it professionally or on the personal front,” says Anusha

The balancing act

“It doesn’t mind whether it is small screen or big screen, for me, it is the character which matters the most. I believe if the character and the script are good, people will definitely recognize your work. In films, people will have to go to cinema halls to watch us, which is contrary to small screen, where we reach their door steps with our roles that are closer to their lives,” she says.

Extending horizons “I feel that language is not a barrier for an artiste. An actor emotes the same emotions everywhere. I have acted in a few Telugu and Tamil serials,” she adds.

A new film signing

Anusha has signed a new movie titled Khadak which has Dharma Keerthiraj in the lead. “I play a stylish college student who likes to lead a carefree life. She is addicted to doing videos on TikTok. After one of her videos goes viral, she accidentally meets the protagonist,” she reveals."
294,"Updated: Apr 6, 2019, 14:35 IST",TNN,Entertainment,Here’s why Vijay Suriya and Chaitra made their appearance on television,"Fans of Vijay Suriya were in for a treat over the weekend. The long-held curiosity about the newly-married actor and wife Chaitra finally came to an end with the couple making their first television appearance on the Ugadi special episode of Majaa Talkies. In a first, Chaitra and Vijay speak to BT about their debut TV outing. When they were approached for the show:
Vijay: When Srujan Lokesh (host) told me that he wants us to come on his show, I was a little sceptical. Chaitra is new to all this and I was concerned about her comfort. So obviously I said no. But when Srujan said it will be a casual chat with a bit of fun questions thrown in. I asked Chaitra if she would like to do it and she said ok. That’s how it all came together.
Chaitra: Initially, I was a little hesitant about going on the show because this is a whole different world to me. But then when you’re married to an actor, this was bound to happen sooner or later. So I thought, “ok, let’s just do it.” It was nice.

Highlight of the show:

Vijay: For the first time, the two most important ladies in my life were on TV with me. It was also amma’s first time on the small screen along with Chaitra. Chaitra: I think everyone was curious to know who Mrs Vijay Suriya is and what she looks like, so the two of us coming together on stage for the first time was a highlight.

Memorable moment:

Vijay: During the reception, we never got to dance even though we wanted to because the celebrations went on till quite late and we were left with no time to dance. We had our first dance on the show and grooved to Yenammi. Amma joined us later on. So it was fun.

Chaitra: I think it was when Vijay made that impromptu talk of being by my side forever and asking me to repose my trust in him always. It was so heart-felt and I got all misty eyed.

Short takes:

Chaitra calls Vijay ‘Baba’ and ‘Muddu’. Vijay calls her ‘Babu’ and ‘Hendthi’. The song Chaitra likes to dedicate to Vijay is Ninagoskara from Ishtakamya."
295,Gunjan.Sharma@timesgroup.com,TNN,Entertainment,I could connect with my character’s conflict in Kavaludaari: Rishi,"He stole everyone’s heart as the lovable Purmy in Operation Alamelamma, but in his next, Kavaludaari, Rishi takes on a role that is poles apart from his 2017 film — that of a conflicted traffic cop SK Shyam. As the film releases this week, Rishi talks to us about the many layers he had to explore as Shyam, why he goes beyond the character sketch, and working with the Godhi Banna Sadharana Mykattu dream team — director Hemanth M Rao and veteran actor Anant Nag. Was Godhi… the reason you wanted to work on this film?

I met Hemanth for the first time much before Godhi…, when he was auditioning actors for another project. I figured out then itself that he is a very sensible person and was sure that whatever film he made in the future would be very interesting. He proved that with Godhi… Hemanth had told me that if he writes the role of a cop, he would want to cast me for it. After the Operation Alamelamma teaser came out, he called me and I was onboard for Kavaludaari.

Purmy and Shyam seem to be very different from each other…
They are poles apart. Operation Alamelamma was about entertaining people, so the approach I took as an actor was a mixed bag. But in Kavaludaari, the challenge was to be as rooted and honest to the character as possible, and not step out of it for even a moment. Hemanth had told me that there are many layers to Shyam, and that he doesn’t speak much, but is always thinking and figuring out what’s happening. Shyam also has personal conflicts, and I personally find struggle to be an inspiration. I’m an engineer, but wanted to be an actor, so I could connect with Shyam’s conflict, because he wanted to be in crime investigation, but got posted in traffic. So, he’s always battling that conflict. Hemanth wanted to explore the emotional side of policemen — not just show how strong they are, but also expose their vulnerabilities. He didn’t want me to be a filmy cop, who is macho and can beat up 50 guys. He wanted me to look like a cop that you normally see on the streets. So, I had to add my own perspective into it as an actor and find more details to my character, like where he was born, what school he went to and what his parents did. The audience will not see all of this onscreen, but these details are important to portray the character.

Working with Anant Nag must have been a different experience for you…

You know, I wasn’t intimidated by him at all. Within minutes of meeting him on the day of the muhurata, there was no ice left to break. I hadn’t met him before that day, but the way he spoke to me and greeted me was very warm. It felt like I was working with a colleague my age. I was very excited and there was no nervousness on the first day of shoot. I had one of the best actors in the country as my co-actor, which meant that I could just freak out. I didn’t have to do much. I knew that if I just take some material from what he does, I might also end up looking good onscreen. Despite his experience, he doesn’t give suggestions on the skills of an actor, but is constantly thinking about the scene. We call him a genius, but I think that the secret of being a genius is to carry the spirit of a child within you and not lose enthusiasm, no matter what. He’s been in the film industry for over four decades, but when you see him onscreen, he’s very fresh. I had a lot to learn from him. What was it like working with an avant-garde filmmaker like Hemanth?

One thing that Hemanth had told me even before starting this film was that he did not want to repeat anything that he had done with Godhi… During the shoot of Kavaludaari, whenever Hemanth thought that a shot was even remotely close to what he did in Godhi…, he would immediately change it, even if it looked good. He was challenging himself and competing with this own thoughts. He is not only a good director, but a very good human being. He is always very kind and sensitive to his actors, and truly values artistes."
296,Debarati S Sen,TNN,Entertainment,Tapan Basu: We carried out a chase sequence in 'RAW' in three cities,"Tapan Basu, a celebrated cinematographer who worked in the recently released 'Romeo Akbar Walter', talks about his experience and what the future holds for espionage dramas like 'RAW'. He says, “My experience in RAW was super challenging and exciting . We created the ‘70s era and we focused on the early formation of 'RAW'. We shot in Kashmir , Gujarat , Mumbai , Nepal . We shot in over 14 cities 114 locations 2 countries and all this in just 46 days. We had done extensive research for the film beforehand which helped us during the shoot. To create the old charm we shot on old anamorphic lens with some camera filtration , a small section on super 16 mm film.”

Shooting a movie in live locations with stars has its own challenges especially when it comes to managing the crowd. Corroborating this fact, Tapan says, “In the movie, we have a long chase sequence. This chase is actually shot in three different cities and that too in a crazy order, we first shot the end then the middle and the ultimately the beginning . I wanted a certain tone to it and the film needed the overcast look and challenge was to maintain the look in three cities and to make it seem seamless.”

When asked about his experience of working with veteran actor, Jackie Shroff, he says, “ It was a wonderful experience working with him. He had no airs. As I saw him on the first day, I was reminded of his iconic role King Uncle, and I kept calling him King Uncle during the entire shoot.”"
297,Sumit Jha,TNN,Entertainment,I’d want a film on the human being that I am: Satabdi Roy,"Because of your political commitment, have you detached yourself from cinema?
Yes, almost. Politics and films both are full-time jobs and can be very demanding. Both need a lot of planning and thinking. So, it’s really hard to continue with my film career while I am into full-time politics. I frequently travel to Delhi and Birbhum and it’s hard to pull off a perfect balancing act. It’s true that I miss working in films, but when I see that my present work is bringing smile on people’s faces, I feel happy. I am working for people and I think what I am doing now is very important.

Would you want a film made on your life as an actress/politician?
(Laughs) That would never happen. But if it does, then I would want a film on Satabdi Roy as a human being.

Being a member of the film industry, do you have any concrete plans to help the single screen theatres in Bengal, as their numbers are fast going down?

A few years ago, I took some initiatives. But one thing we all have to understand that theatres mean business and if the business is down, then I don’t know how to keep the single screens going. For example, now we are all using AC cars and smart phones instead of non-AC cars and basic phones. It all depends on the need of people. And single screens are closing down the world over.

Last month, when Mimi and Nusrat joined politics, there were memes and personal attacks on social media. How did you react?

Today, trolling and bullying are rampant on social media. I have seen jokes on a person, who died recently. This is unacceptable. Sharing opinion is one thing and targeting others quite another. People are free to express their political thoughts, but no one has the right to attack others.

Why do actresses have to make an effort to be simpletons during campaigns? Isn’t the Indian voter mature enough to accept a star the way he or she is?


It’s not just actors, but whoever joins politics has to maintain certain decorum. When I came into politics, many asked me to stay away from lipsticks, wear light-coloured saris and not to use AC Cars. It’s true that I followed some of these, but that was to change the notion people had about me. I wanted to make people understand that they were looking at a politician and not an actor. Otherwise, even at a political rally, people would go with the image they had about me and ask me to deliver film dialogues on stage! When that changed, I resorted to comfort clothes.


How do you keep yourself stress-free during the election time?

I don’t take any extra pressure. I go with the flow. For instance, on Sunday, I went to Rajdanga. It was extremely hot and humid. I was exhausted even before reaching the spot. But when I saw those people and the way they welcomed me,

my stress was gone. It happens every time. When you file the nomination, don’t you ever feel that the declared assets would also be scrutinised?"
298,Debarati S Sen,TNN,TV,City witnesses litterateurs discuss politics,"The smart city witnessed a first-of-its-kind literary discussion called Cafetaria on Saturday evening at a city-based bookstore inside a mall in Jayadev Vihar area. The event was a sort of a get-together where litterateurs discussed politics just before the first phase of the general elections on April 11.

The literary event provided a superb platform for the poets, writers, authors, youngsters and literature and politics enthusiasts to discuss pressing issues affecting one and all. Besides, there was poetry recitation which had politics as its central theme.


Renowned poets and writers like Saqti Mohanty, Bharat Majhi, Hiranmayee Mishra, Kedar Mishra and Eli Mohanty took part in the discussions. Pabitra Mohan Kar, Subrat Senapati, Pratyus Mishra, Suman Dash, Bharat Majhi and Bhaswati Basu recited poems on this occasion. Poet Kedar Mishra moderated the discussion.

They discussed various issues like whether politics can be a good profession, should there be eligibility criteria for aspiring politicians and how can politics be more inclusive and participatory.


Saqti said he wishes to directly take part in politics once in his lifetime. Similarly, Hiranmayee also wished to join politics towards the end of her career. “We are all interested in politics and we wish to join it someday. It will depend on the individual as to how they want to go about doing that,” said Saqti.


Subhashree Shubhasmita Mishra and Bhaswati Basu organised the informal literary event. Cafeteria aims at holding more such literary discussions which will bring up important issues concerning the residents and also look to a way forward."
299,Sumit Jha,TNN,Entertainment,KLF’s series a hit among literature enthusiasts,"Kalinga Literary Festival organised its campus series at the first KLF Campus in the Indian Institute of Mass Communication (IIMC), Dhenkanal recently. National Sahitya Academy award-winning writer professor Shantanu Acharya was the guest of honour for a session and he deliberated on knowledge and society.


Speaking on the occasion, Shantanu said deep within the modern Indian society, the cultural and philosophical heritage of this country is still alive. “Indian society and culture are based on the rich ancient philosophy and science of Vedas and sages. This makes India what it is in its truest sense,” said the writer.


The one-day event had several sessions and various topics were discussed. The revered writer also answered a number of questions asked by students and faculty members in an interactive session.

In another session at the event, regional director of IIMC Dhenkanal Mrinal Chatterjee deliberated on the topic Adaption of literature into cinema. Speaking on this, Mrinal said, “While adapting literary classics into feature films, the makers have to keep the soul of the story intact. No doubt, the physical shape of the story will change due to logistical reasons but if the director can recreate the emotion and intellectual impact that can make the creation immortal.”


Assistant professor of IIMC, Dhenkanal Jyoti Prakash Mohapatra explained how Odia literature has been showcased on the silver screen and why filmmakers here are shying away from adapting literature to films.


The event also saw a poetry reading session where many poets took part and cultural performances were also organised. Not only the students and faculty members of the institute attended the event but also eminent people from various sectors and those with interest in literature were present at the literary event."

301,Gunjan.Sharma@timesgroup.com,TNN,Entertainment,A biographical play on Amrita Sher-Gil takes centre stage in Bengaluru,"Picture this: You enter a space to watch a play and the entire stage slowly transforms into a canvas, with projections of colourful lights splashed on the actors. A similar atmosphere is created for Organizational Theatre’s latest ‘mega theatre musical play’, which follows the life and struggles of Indian-Hungarian painter, Amrita Sher-Gil. Taking the stage at Ranga Shankara on April 13, this devised performance is one hour long and features an ensemble cast of 25 actors.

“Although, Amrita Sher-Gil is often remembered as an avant-garde artist of the early 20th century, a quick research would point out a lack of documented works relating to her life and the contributions she made to uplift women back in the day, through her art,” says Ranji David, the director of the play, adding, “As one of the prominent faces of modern Indian art, Amrita, at one point of history, had become the voice of Indian women. Her paintings not just mirrored their struggles, but were also progressive in nature.”

The play, Amrita Sher-Gil, is a biographical piece that traces certain important aspects of the legendary painter’s life. It also touches upon the controversies and mysteries that she was shrouded in, but in a symbolic manner. “The audiences are open to have their own individual interpretations. Largely crafted in a non-scripted format, the play employs paints and projections on stage. Movements, lights and visuals claim an essential part of the performance, as the actors sway around following a rhythmic technique of storytelling. The costumes are white, so is the backdrop — giving the impression of one big canvas. Music from that era is used as the background score, with the cello forming a profound note,” Ranji explains. Currently, on its fifth show, the play was devised within a period of nine months, with experts like Elena Roncoroni, Katrina Menshikova and Anirudh Roy mentoring the actors with movements and art.

What is most unique about the entire show is that apart from the play, the audiences will also be treated to an art exhibition, displaying some 30 paintings done by the actors. “Since, we were working on a biographical play of a painter, it became pertinent to learn the nuances of the art that she practised and preached. Most of the actors were putting a brush on the canvas for the first time, but some of their final works emerged quite outstanding. It’s like exploring an inherent talent that you didn’t know you had,” says Ranji, who himself is highly inspired by Amrita, and is also a self-taught painter.

The theatre collective aims at touring with the play, with a bigger cast over the coming months. “Amrita’s story is about women, and it is relevant in today’s time too,” the director sums up."

This soulful love song is the 21-year-old singer’s fourth single with T-Series, which recently signed her on as their in-house music talent. The song, composed by Tanishk Bagchi and written by Arafat Mehmood, is also Dhvani’s first collaboration with singer Nikhil D’Souza. The video was shot at St Xavier’s college to capture the innocence of young love on the campus.

It was directed by the talented duo Radhika Rao – Vinay Sapru, who have shot the singer’s previous videos like 'Leja Re' and 'Main Teri Hoon', too. “Shooting for the song at the college was fun. I study at KC College, so I find the atmosphere in both the colleges different. However, it still felt like home. It was so comfortable that I just had to be me,” says Dhvani. The video also features Siddharth Gupta and Anuj Saini.


Dhvani, who has always dreamt of being a pop singer, says, “I am grateful to have an opportunity to work with such beautiful voices and composers so early on in my career. Collaborating with Tanishk sir (for songs 'Dilbar', 'Leja Re' and 'Vaaste'), Guru Randhawa ('Ishare Tere'), Sachin-Jigar ('Main Teri Hoon') and Vishal Mishra ('Laila') have been an enriching experience. I am glad Nikhil joined me for this new single.”"
303,Richa Shukla,TNN,Entertainment,Shaheer Sheikh’s shayari lands him in a soup!,"Not many know that TV actor Shaheer Sheikh is a poet and has been writing shayari since the age of 15. And this passion landed him in trouble recently. A few days ago, Shaheer said in an interview that he had written some shayari for one of the initial episodes of his show, 'Yeh Rishtey Hain Pyaar Ke' when they were shooting in Bhuj. This didn’t go down well with the writer of the show, Divy Sharma, who immediately took to social media to express his views on how he was upset with the actor wrongly taking credit for his work. Shaheer was soon trolled for this. Some actors and producers from the TV industry also supported the writer.

Shaheer then apologised with a tweet, which read, “Sorry Divy, Nidhi Sharma Ji. I was talking to the PR team, I told them that I write and I wrote a few lines for the initial few episodes also, and then we got a new writer and his shayaris are good. I would never want to put my name on anybody’s work. I did write a few lines, which I am not really proud of because it’s very average (sic).”


He further tweeted, “And I thought of it while standing in the scene in front of the camera. This is what I still remember writing, ‘Jo reh gaya peeche nisha jo chut gae halki is yaad.. uska bas yahi kehna hai, ki humari kismat mein firse milna hai’ (sic).”

He added, “Sorry didn’t mean to hurt anyone. I guess apart from this they made me dub a few new shayaris which I guess were yours, but if you say that you have written this also, then I agree to that as well. I don’t want to take credit for writing as I am just an actor and that’s what I do when I am on set (sic).”

When Bombay Times spoke to Divy, he said, “Shaheer is a big actor and has done some very good work on TV. My only bone of contention was that those shayaris were written by us and not by him. That’s it. We respect him and work will go on as usual. As for me, the matter has ended after Mr. Sheikh’s statement. It was handled amicably by everyone involved and has ended gracefully, but the larger question of screenwriters not getting their due credit and importance still remains. Be it in films or television, it is high time that people start acknowledging the writer’s contribution.”


Shaheer could not be contacted, but a source close to him revealed that he is hurt with the entire episode. “Shaheer writes good poetry,” said the source, adding, “When we had started shooting the first few episodes in Bhuj, he had penned down a few couplets and at that time, the team of writers were not on board. Some of his shayaris were used in the second episode. He had no intention of taking away the writer’s credit. He understands that TV is a writer’s medium and no show or actor is

bigger than the script. Hence, it was gracious of him to apologise.”


Clearly, Shaheer is still upset with the incident as is evident from his tweets over the weekend. He tweeted: “Ek zarre sa wajood hai mera..Mujhe takh-toh taaj ke aas nahi..Sab alfaaz likhe jo wo tere hain..mere seene mein jazbaat nahi.. Gungunata tha aksar mein tere alfazonko. Afsoos magar ab..Mere huntho pe wo saaz nahi. (sic)”"

Composed by Ajay Singha with lyrics by Shelle and Mohit Pathak, the compositions sits well with the mysterious storyline revolving around Laura Costa (essayed by Spanish actress Lorena Franco), whose search for her lost husband brings her to Paharganj. Acclaimed singers like Mohit Chauhan, Kavita Seth, Romy, Shalmali Kholgade, Brijesh Sandilya and Shilpa Surroch wove their magic to the music with their renditions of the soundtracks. In fact, Mohit’s 'Kyun Dil Mera' has managed to retain its position among the top ten popular songs for two consecutive weeks. A ghazal-style melody, the song has been praised for its unhurried pace, the use of tabla and Mohit’s voice. 'Bairaagi Mann' is the other most-played song from the album.

However, the makers received a bigger validation when the film was specially screened for the R&AW (Research & Analysis Wing) chief, Anil Kumar Dhasmana and a host of other RAW officers. In a first for any Bollywood film, 'RAW' was screened before the film’s release for the officers and their families. An espionage thriller based in the period of 1971, the film is a tribute to the nameless and faceless men and women who operate behind enemy lines.

Writer-director Robbie Grewal was present at the screening with Jackie Shroff, who plays the RAW chief in the film. He informs, “My film is a tribute to these officers and so, it was a surreal experience to show my film to them. It was equally gratifying to have RAW officers and their families walk up to you to acknowledge and appreciate the effort put in the film. One of the most fulfilling experiences was to meet the chief of RAW and interact with him. I was overwhelmed with the warm reception to us and the film.”


Besides Jackie, the film cast also includes John Abraham, Mouni Roy, Sikandar Kher, Suchitra Krishnamoorthi and Raghubir Yadav in pivotal roles. 'Romeo Akbar Walter (RAW)' is produced by Viacom18 Motion Pictures, Dheeraj Wadhawan, Ajay Kapoor, Vanessa Walia, and Gary Grewal."

Because I have been doing theatres for so long, I have done ads in the past and moreover, achhe bade logon ke saath kaam kiya hai so I don’t get nervous on set now. In fact, I get excited and want to work with more senior actors now.”

Giving credit to his theatre background in bagging this role, Aashay says the medium has trained him well in acting. “I have been doing theatre since I was a child in school. The place where I stand today, I give all my credit to theatre. The confidence that I hold today is because of this medium which has taught me so much. The thing that I find interesting about theatre and stage performances is that you have a direct connection with the audience. You know what they are feeling and through that you know how you are performing. And I think that is the best part because taaliyon ki gadhgadhahat se achhi cheez kuchh nahi hoti, jo aapko nahi milegi while shooting on a set. Doing a show or acting in a show, or even the movies, you get the feedback on social media after the show is over or when you ask your parents or friends ki show kaisa laga, but doing a play, you get the feedback right then and there, which is very satisfying,” said Aashay. — Saad Abbasi"
307,"Updated: Apr 6, 2019, 18:16 IST",TNN,Entertainment,"Vivek Anand Oberoi: I’m the guy whose professional obituaries have been surfacing since 2004, but I am still here, unbreakable","Vivek Anand Oberoi has been in the news since December last year, ever since it was announced that he would headline the cast of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s biopic, titled 'PM Narendra Modi'. In January, posters of the film featuring Vivek as PM Modi were launched in over 20 languages. All of these, including the teaser and trailer that were unveiled in the subsequent months, collectively drew more criticism than appreciation for the film. Recently, the movie was even dragged to court and accused of being ‘propaganda material’. Today is a crucial day for the film’s makers, as a petition against it is expected to be heard in the Supreme Court. In the meanwhile, according to a statement given by the producers, its release date has now been moved to April 11 from April 5. Vivek spoke to Bombay Times about his journey which has been anything but a cakewalk...
Bank Chor, Krrish 3 and Great Grand Masti were some of your last films that released between 2016 and 17. With PM Narendra Modi slated for release this week, and with all the controversies surrounding it, are you anxious?
More than anything else, I’m eager for the audience to watch this film. We’ve put in our heart and soul into it and the journey has been incredible. It was almost impossible, but we finished the film with its scale intact, in 38 days. We travelled from the hot landscape of Kutch to the freezing terrain of Harsil (Uttarakhand). This film was more difficult and taxing for me than all the 45 films I’ve done in my 18-year-long career.


It's learnt that you were being considered to play PM Modi for another biopic, much before this film was made. Why didn’t that project happen?
It wasn’t one project. A lot of people thought of making a film on Modiji, including me. In my case, it started when I attended the swearing-in ceremony in 2014. Everyone believed his story amazing, but Sandeep Ssingh (producer) was the only one to say it with conviction, ‘Main bana raha hoon, aap aaiye’. Omung Kumar was approached to direct, but he wasn’t sure at the outset. I told him that he shouldn’t shy away from what he’s good at, which is making biopics. It will be interesting to see what his take on the subject is because he is politically insulated. For Omung, it was about unravelling the layers of a man’s personality. I am politically astute and I understand it. I was involved with student politics and during my student years, I was also a GS in the university.

What is it that really drives you to give the nod to a project such as this biopic?
I am on two extremes. When I am working on a film, I am committed and I give it my all. Cold and hot weather and a demanding scene don’t deter me, but I only take up a project when I am inspired enough. It’s not for the money or the thrill of adding another film to my CV. Like I took up Lucifer in Malayalam, knowing that it’s a tough language to speak. But my reason for doing it was that I didn’t want to miss a chance to reunite with Mohanlal (they worked in Company, 2002). I was also warned against trying new media (web series). I was told I would end up getting written-off completely, but here I am. I didn’t sink.

Your career started with a bang with Saathiya and Company. You were touted to be one of the most promising actors in the early 2000s. Interesting roles and intense performances also won you accolades. Given this, your career graph has not been as extensive as it could have been. Do you feel you could have given more to the industry and received more from it?
I’m the guy whose professional obituaries have been surfacing since 2004. Due or no due, the fact is that I am still here, unbreakable. I have worked in six languages and won around 20 awards and I still get some great work to do. Instead of being in the rat-race, and running to the finishing line, I am spending time watching my kids grow. Acting gives me joy, but so does playing football in the garden with my son and lighting up my daughter’s doll-house with her. I am on crazy schedule even now, but I don’t miss a chance to feed my bachchas and break bread with my wife and parents. I believe in maintaining work-life balance. Each day makes me feel like a winner and gives me a sense of fulfillment. I’ve often been asked about not getting my due in the industry. On the contrary, I am blessed with so much that I don’t see life in a unidimensional manner. I have a happy family and I choose the work I do. I am Destiny’s child because there’s nothing that hasn’t happened to shut me down and I'm still going strong. This is my life and I have accepted it with a smile. What else can I do? Crying is not an option, woh sab screen pe theek hai.

Shortly after you attended the PM’s swearing-in ceremony, people made memes of your look at the event with comments about how you even made it there...
(Laughs!) Yes, I remember that. It still makes me smile. In 2004, people said how did I make it to the film industry, in 2014, people asked how did I make it to the PM’s swearing-in ceremony, and in 2019, they are asking how did I get the role. Someday, there will be a
biopic on me if people keep asking these questions, which I don’t mind.

But how did you really make it to PM Modi’s swearing-in ceremony?
I don’t like to wear my relationships on my sleeves. I built a beautiful equation with Mr Modi when he was the Chief Minister (CM) of Gujarat. I’ve personally seen him work, and people don’t realise this but after Atal Bihari Vajpayee, he’s the only leader I campaigned for.

So, at some point, you do plan to get into politics?
I don’t know where life will take me, but for now, you will see me as a full-fledged politician for two hours on screen.

Are you in awe of PM Modi?
I am not a bhakt for sure. For me, it was a question of whether Modiji's story inspires enough. It does. To me, even Dhirubhai Ambani’s story is just as inspirational. I am excited about this film because it tells every chaiwala and chowkidar that you too can become the PM.
It’s often said that getting too close to a subject could hamper your objectivity. In your case, you knew

PM Modi very well. Didn’t that become a deterrent at any point?
One approach is to adapt the physicality of the person you’re playing. Omung and Sandeep ensured that I don’t caricature Modiji. We were clear that the spirit of the man needs to be captured and portrayed. I did that when I played Maya Dolas in Shootout at Lokhandwala (2007). The man had curly hair, but it looked funny when I wore a wig to match his appearance. He also had a thick Marathi accent. Eventually, we decided to go without all of this and just focus on the kind of person Maya was. I studied him in great detail —his criminal history and met the cops who had shot him. The idea was to bring out that high he was riding on in the short span of his life.

Your film has been in the eye of controversies since inception. Even its release date has been moved twice. Did you anticipate that you might have to fight so many battles for this film to see the light of the day?
Yes, one knew that this might happen. Our legal team had warned us, but I could never understand why so many people (referring to political leaders) are scared of this film releasing. And if a film is so powerful, then people in politics should make films instead of campaigning and doing any other work in their constituencies. It’s great for cinema. If that theory was true, every election season would have a flurry of films. I think we’re giving too much importance to this issue. People will watch the film and decide whether it’s good or bad. Making films can never help anyone win elections. If someone thinks it is propaganda, let them prove it.


Biopics in India are often blamed for white-washing their subjects. Your film is being accused of it even before release.
Let them blame us, but we have never given that a thought. I’ve made this film for the mass audience. I’m told that Richard Attenborough was also accused of white-washing Mahatma Gandhi in Gandhi. The film is considered to be iconic. Uske aage hamari film ki kya haisiyat hai?


In a two-hour film, how much of Modi’s life have you really covered? Does your film also touch upon the Gujarat riots, which took place in 2002?
We’ve covered a great spectrum. Omung has done tremendous justice in his effort to bring out as much of Modiji’s life as possible in a short screen time of about two hours. There’s everything right up to his swearing-in ceremony. It’s his trials and tribulations that make the film inspirational.


Lastly, will we get to see Narendra Modi in the film?
We tried incorporating a portion at the end but it didn’t work. There is enough Modi in me, but not the real Modiji in the film."
308,Richa Shukla,TNN,Lifestyle,"Shakti Anand, Falaq Naaz ousted overnight from television show","Actors Shakti Anand and Falaq Naaz were in for a shock when they learnt about their exit from the TV show, 'Vish Ya Amrit: Sitara', on the day of shoot. A disappointed Shakti says, “I wasn’t informed about it till I shot my death scene. I had been in talks with the makers regarding my track a month after the show went on air in December. I was pushing them to make me understand why they had signed me in the first place, as the role had nothing to offer. I didn’t want to travel for hours to reach the set and feel tortured. My wife (Sai Deodhar) would ask me every day about the shoot, hoping that I must have done something concrete, but I was doing nothing other than standing in a puja, shaadi or birthday.”


Shakti adds, “I told the makers that if I didn’t have a role to play, then they should bring it to an end, but I had no clue that it would unfold in such a manner. Just a month ago, they had told me that they had great plans for my character and the story would revolve around me.”

He further says, “I was shocked when I learnt about my death sequence on the show. My director, who wasn’t aware of it either, actually thought that it was a dream sequence. I totally understand that it’s the makers’ prerogative to treat a character in a way they want to, but all they needed was to inform me of my exit in advance. I don’t wish to blame anyone, but it definitely leaves a bad taste in the mouth. How can an actor be treated in this manner? You can give me a double role, triple role or even kill me, but not like this. I guess sometimes you just write a character, but fail to justify it.”


A disturbed Falaq shares, “Why is an actor expected to inform the makers in advance when they want to quit a project, while producers can axe any character overnight without prior intimation? All I expect as an artiste is to be informed about my exit in advance. I learnt about my exit a day before I shot the last scene, but no one from the team told me about it. Even today, I am waiting for the creative team to get in touch with me.”


She adds, “I understand that it could be the demand of the story, but at least inform the artiste. After seeing my fate, my co-actors are also worried if they will also be treated in a similar fashion. This is the first time I have faced something like this in my career. This has instilled fear in me for the future.”"
309,"Updated: Apr 6, 2019, 15:29 IST",TNN,Entertainment,"Vivek Anand Oberoi: I may not be a bhakt – but of course, I am a Modi fan","Vivek Anand Oberoi, who plays the titular role in the upcoming PM Narendra Modi, talks about the film’s various controversies and whether he is a Narendra Modi bhakt or fan. Excerpts:
Usually, when a Hindi film faces a legal hurdle or call for ban, artistes in Bollywood are quick to jump to the filmmakers’ support. When PM Narendra Modi faced those calls and scrutiny by the Election Commission, let alone the ‘liberals’ in the industry, even the Bollywood fraternity which is usually vocal in its support for PM Modi has not lent a hand of support. Were you surprised at that?
Very! Surprised and also disappointed because I believe that somewhere, we as an industry have the same problem that India has had over so many years – we have never learnt to unite. And that’s why it’s so easy to break us. It just takes one person to decide ‘we are going to create a divide’, and they are not only able to do it, but get away with it too. We don’t learn from episodes like 'My Name Is Khan' or 'Padmaavat'. And this is not about left-leaning, right-leaning or centrism. It’s not about political ideology. It’s just wrong. It’s the fundamental right of a filmmaker to make a film on what they believe in, and it’s the fundamental right of the viewer to watch and discern whether they like it or not. It’s as simple as that. We need to protect that right. We have all these pro-democracy, death of democracy, doomsday predictions going on everywhere. I don’t see one of them even tweeting, “Yaar, yeh galat hai, yeh nahi hona chahiye. Please stop attacking this film. Let the film release’!”


So you’re saying freedom of expression in the industry is the domain of one particular ideology?
I think it’s convenience. Freedom of expression has become an expression of convenience now. They don’t come out and stand in support for us. No matter what the film says or depicts, it is a medium and you are standing for the principle of things. It can’t be, ‘Iss film ke liye freedom hona chahiye, uss film ke liye nahi hona chahiye’. That’s rubbish!

This film isn’t the first political biopic in Hindi cinema this year. Both 'Thackeray' and 'The Accidental Prime Minister' had acclaimed actors playing the titular role, but both portrayals were criticised for being too caricature-ish and gimmicky. Does that make you nervous?
Not at all. We took a conscious call when we did our video tests not to go nasal and not to try and mimic Modi ji. Because Modi ji has a whole range when he speaks. In an interview, he speaks differently, in person, he speaks differently. When he speaks on stage, it is still different. When you look at the whole range, when you look at a thousand hours of video footage, we took a conscious call not to mimic him, not to make an absolute caricature of him because that would be ridiculing him. Our attempt is not to show ki look how good I am at copying something. My attempt is how can we encapsulate and emulate the spirit of this incredible man who came from nothing, from nowhere, selling chai on a little railway platform in a town nobody knew about, to becoming a world leader. How did he become the most followed world leader on social media, and somebody who has evoked such strong emotions that people thump their chests and proudly call themselves ‘bhakts’. It’s never happened before. That’s an inspirational story.

Is Vivek Oberoi a Modi fan?
I am, of course. I mean, it’s evident from the portrayal of the film. I may not be a bhakt. I may not be somebody who closes my eyes and says, no matter what happens, jo Modi ji karenge sahi karenge, achha hi karenge. I may not agree with everything. I discern, I think about everything and then I take a balanced view.

Vivek's presence at Modi's swearing-in ceremony in 2014 was talked about

You’ve been a vocal supporter of Narendra Modi since before he became PM. You attended his swearing-in in 2014. So did you reach out to the producers to play him or was it the other way round? How did you come into the picture?
The producers did, and it took me a really long time to decide to do the film – all of 30 seconds! Sandeep Ssingh said, ‘Look, we have done a bunch of tests with a few actors but we are not sure. We are not sure if you will match the physicality. You will have to put on weight, but why not you?’. Thirty seconds later I said I’m doing the film. We shook hands, sat down and worked on the script. I did the research, I was part of the whole script-writing process. It was really exciting.

You have done films based on real life before – 'Shootout At Lokhandwala' and 'Rakta Charitra'. Some of your most successful films have been where you played gangsters. Now, you play the Prime Minister. That’s quite the contrast. How did it feel as an actor?
Shifting is easy but playing Narendra Modi is challenging. You’ve got two aspects – physical and mental. The physical aspect is five-six hours of prosthetic make-up. You have to change the face to in some way resemble him, in the way the mouth looks, the face looks. The body language, the gestures, to pick those up and sprinkle them and not make it look forced. But the mental part is even tougher. To be that person of that fortitude, to have that power and shine in the eyes; it’s so difficult to bring that. I did my own crazy little processes for that. I turned purely saatvik. No matter what time I slept, I would wake up by 3am, do an hour of meditation and prayer and get into make-up by 4, to be in time for the 9am shift.


So you adopted his routine...
Yes, and it was tough doing it just for the 60 days of the shoot. Then I thought, he has been doing it for almost 60 years. Kudos!

You said that you are a Modi fan and that you believe in him and his politics. Does an actor necessarily need to believe in the character he plays?
No, not necessarily. It depends on how good an actor you are. But in my scenario, I believe in him. I believe in Narendra Modi being an inspiration today, particularly for the youth who are aimless. Today when he is on a pedestal as the Prime Minister, it might be difficult to connect. But when you see him as a youth, in the years when he was confused too, there is a connect. Even if it was back in the ’60s and ’70s, there is a connect.


PM Modi’s life story is out in the public eye. Cinematically, what is the challenge in not letting such a story become a documentary?
There is that challenge. We were never intending to make it a documentary. We wanted to have an emotional high and for that purpose, you do fictionalise a little bit, dramatise a little bit. You focus on the spirit of the moment rather than the exactness of it. It’s not a documentary. It’s not about ‘this happened on this day and this time and he was wearing yellow and red at that point’. The idea is to capture the spirit and the thought of the man at that time so that it connects with you somewhere and inspires you.

But in dramatising or fictionalising a story about a political figure who is alive and active, don’t you feel you sacrifice objectivity?
Objectivity is the purpose of documentary filmmakers. For me, Gandhi is an inspirational film. Similarly, 'Sardar', 'Kesari', and 'Mary Kom' are all inspirational films. I can sit down and watch a documentary on Mary Kom’s journey also. Maybe she would say I never milked cows (referring to a scene in the film), but for me to see that on film is a beautiful moment, because that girl goes from milking cows to boxing people in the ring. That is a moment. So for me, it’s not about objectivity. My motive is to create a tale of inspiration and aspiration.

So when is Modi going to see the film?
(Laughs) There is no way I can answer that.


The film has been called a propaganda tool for the ruling party by many. Do you believe films hold the power to sway voters’ minds?

That’s for them to answer, the ones who are alleging this. If they feel this is how influential a film can be, then stop campaigning, you also make a film. Why spend so much time and energy going from pillar to post, touring every single village and city and campaigning and doing sabhas? Don’t do it. Just make a film, since you believe only a film can influence voters. Aap bhi banao. In fact, if you think anything that influences a voter’s mind shouldn’t happen during election time, stop all news shows, stop all the editorials in newspapers. Stop free speech completely till elections are on. Stop anybody from standing on a stage and saying, ‘I believe in Narendra Modi’ or ‘I believe in Rahul Gandhi’.


Allegations of propaganda aside, was it a deliberate call to release the film so close to the elections?

Yes, it was!


Because of commercial reasons?

It’s not just about commercial interests. There is a time for everything, and this is the right time. And who picks that time? We get to pick that time. We get to pick what we want to make, that’s our fundamental right. We get to choose when we want to release it and the audience gets to choose whether they want to watch it or not. That’s the hallmark of a democracy."
310,"Updated: Apr 6, 2019, 15:29 IST",TNN,Entertainment,When Maharashtrian swag took over city streets,"Vibrant colours, energetic dances, bikes and a lot of band baaja — celebrations of Gudi Padwa, the Marathi New Year, took place with much pomp and gusto in the city on Saturday. A large procession of over 600 people gathered at the CCRT grounds in Madhapur as Maharashtrians in the city thronged the streets to welcome the festival of spring and participate in the much awaited ShobhaYatra.

The women donned the traditional nauvari sarees in hues of yellow, red and purple paired with the distinct Maharashtrian orange turban, called Pheta, the nath (nose-ring) and sunglasses. They upped the swag quotient by heading the procession on their bikes, and were followed by the men in their white kurtas and side-caps, carrying the ceremonial saffron flag. Kids looked adorable sporting the nauvari look too.


An array of colourful rangolis adorned the streets as the grand celebration began on a divine note with the authentic renditions of the Varkari Vitthal bhajans. It was followed by a spectacular Lezim performance by a group of women dancers who showcased the beauty of the rythmic Maharashtrian folk dace form.

One of the highlights of the vibrant carnival was a gang of ladies who were playing the dhol tasha and that instantly amped up the the energy levels and got everyone swaying to their beats. “The dhol weighs almost 10-12 kgs but that didn’t deter the ladies. It’s wonderful to see that every year, the entire Maharashtrian community comes together to celebrate Gudi Padwa, despite their stringent work schedules as both the men and women folks who participate, are from the IT sector,” says Akhilesh Washikar, one of the organisers of the event.




The festivities continued with much gusto, despite the heavy showers. Giant posters of Maharashtrian icons — from Jyotiba Phule, Rani Laxmibai to Ambedkar and more — adorned vehicles which were part of the procession that went on all evening. Mallakhamb performances by young boys showcasing gymnastic acts on a pole kept the shutterbugs and selfie hunters busy. The event also had lip-smacking festive foods like sakkar bhaat (sweet rice), shrikhand puri, and puran poli."

Currently riding the wave of his hit Bumblebee, which got nominated for the best rock artist award on a popular radio channel, Ameeth says the timing of the song’s release was odd. “My bandmates didn’t want that song to be released, but I decided to release it anyway under my name. They all left... but who knew this would be nominated! Over the years, I’ve learnt that the only constant in the Junkyard Groove has been me and me alone. And this is why I decided to go solo. We do have musicians in the band, but they keep changing,” says Ameeth.
So, ask him what’s new on the work front and Ameeth is quick to respond, “Right now, I’m concentrating on making new videos, putting out the content and producing for other bands in Chennai and Hyderabad. I am working on the production of my own music and it should be out this year. I have also begun work on shooting videos for our earlier work and busy taking songwriting classes.”

While he enjoys doing all of these, working on the videos was quite a tough task, says Ameeth. “Video production is something new. I’m learning to do that by myself. I am fascinated by moving pictures and my master classes on this comes from the internet. Video is important as we’re putting a face to the voice. But audio, too, has a huge part to play. All the top-notch musicians ensure their audio is top class. I am a musician and songwriter first and then a production guy. I have vivid imagination. When I want to learn something, I just relate to things I have learnt before. That way, I am able to connect the dots.”

Ameeth also reveals that he isn’t too comfortable in front of the camera. “Being in front of the crowd is so much fun and easier for me because I am just being myself. But when a camera is focused on me, I just give a blank stare as if I’m trying to impress the camera,” he laughs.

313,"Updated: Apr 6, 2019, 15:29 IST",TNN,Lifestyle,‘Banning TikTok does not resolve issues of safety’,"The popular video app TikTok has come under the scanner after the Madras High Court asked the Centre to ban it across the country. This is in lieu of a petition that the court has been hearing against the app, which states that children who use the app are vulnerable and likely to be exposed to sexual predators. However, citizens, social influencers, data analysts and legal professionals concur that banning the app won’t put an end to the issue.
Many apps are cause of worry for parents
Entrepreneur Subha Shrinivasan follows a conservative approach with her teenage daughter. “She will turn 14 this year and I don’t plan on giving her a mobile phone. All her school friends have one. She uses WhatsApp, Snapchat and Instagram on my phone, and I keep a tab on her activities. I have banned several apps for safety reasons, but how will I know if she uses any apps in school or not?” she asks.


Apps like TikTok make for popular social media content Sukanya Girish, a college-goer who uses social media extensively, says, “Comedy and dance videos are extremely popular on TikTok. I use the app around 3-4 times a week. I enjoy it because I can entertain people and see myself in a movie of my choice. It brings out the actor in me. The app has definitely helped me increase my followers count, which is why it’s extremely popular among my peers.” Actor Goutham HC chips in, “After using TikTok, I gained a lot of followers, but I stopped using it three months ago, as I felt that it was getting me nowhere.”

‘Banning an app is not the answer’
Subha worries about how one can control the fact that underaged kids can lie about their age when opening accounts on various apps. “I feel that we need to take a few steps back and look at this issue. Banning is not the right step and I don’t think it serves the purpose. It will not prevent kids from becoming vulnerable to the evils online, including pornography, as another app will take the place of the banned one. We need to educate children about social media, abusing technology and the disadvantages of it,” says Subha. Sukanya feels that imposing a ban won’t change anything. “Tomorrow, there will be another app that will be similar to TikTok. There are two categories on the app — one for those above 13 years and another for those above 16 years — so, parents can control what their child is viewing,” she says.

Being careful about the content one posts online
Goutham says that apps like TikTok give people a platform to express themselves and, therefore, be shot into the limelight. But are youngsters at risk when they put videos on the app? “Absolutely. I see the kind of comments that people post on such videos. For kids to be exposed to such responses is not right,” he says, adding, “What can be done is to track the people who are posting unsavoury comments. Also, while one cannot tag a location on the app, if someone puts up a video from an extremely popular location, people will come to know about the person’s whereabouts. One needs to be careful about these things.”



What will happen to all the app data?
Regardless of whether an app is banned or not, or whether the visibility of a certain post is timed or otherwise, data uploaded can be easily downloaded. Data analyst Santhosh Ramu explains, “There are no age verification details for most applications, and most videos posted online do not have proper security mechanisms in place. One needs no authorisation to download the content posted, as it is available in the backend storage, and you can easily access them by using another platform. A ban is never a solution. If it is followed through, what happens to all the data? Most of these apps are connected to other social media platforms, which you might have given access to. So, you might be posting content on one platform, completely unaware that it is getting shared on another, too. Many people believe that they are posting sensitive content only to a certain group of people, but the information can be accessed by others and even be used to blackmail. So, it is not just kids who are at risk. A strict verification process and setting up a committee to regulate and restrict content is required.”



The legal interpretation of Madras HC’s directive
“This order is a direction to prohibit downloading TikTok. When you prohibit something, the subject as such is banned. Now, it is the responsibility of the respondents to ensure that it is not downloaded by any party. Another direction is for the online media not to exhibit any items that come in this particular app. Also, the judges have asked if there’s some thinking within the government to bring in an act like the one in the US — Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act. A few months ago, the Supreme Court was looking at cases of child pornography and it banned many websites. Recently, a colleague was telling me that irrespective of the ban, the content is still available online. What happened was that those sites simply changed the addresses and continued providing the content online. The court can pass orders, but implementation has to be done by the executives and agencies involved. We can’t go on banning things. Instead, we need to create awareness. Authorities need not wait for the court to intervene. Welfare of the state doesn’t only mean giving free goodies, but also ensuring safety of the people.”

— Thomas T Jacob, civil litigator and cybercrime lawyer



TikTok’s statement on Madras HC order

“At TikTok, we are committed to abiding by local laws and regulations. We fully comply with the Information Technology (Intermediaries Guidelines) Rules, 2011. We are currently awaiting the official order by the Honourable High Court of Madras and once received, we will review and take appropriate action regarding this matter. Maintaining a safe and positive in-app environment at TikTok is our priority. We have robust measures to protect users against misuse, protect their privacy and digital wellbeing. This includes easy reporting mechanisms that enable users and law enforcement to report content that violates our terms of use, and comprehensive Community Guidelines. In order to better coordinate with law enforcement agencies, we have appointed a Chief Nodal Officer based out of India.”"

315,"Saptaparna Biswas, Farzana Patowari",TNN,Entertainment,Music review: Majili,"Album: Majili
Genre: Tollywood

Shiva Nirvana’s Majili, starring Naga Chaitanya, Samantha and Divyansha Kaushik in lead roles has been one of the most-awaited releases this summer. The jukebox of the film, composed by Gopi Sundar, has six songs that have already been received well by fans.
First on the album is Maaya Maaya, penned by Bhaskarabhatla and crooned by Anurag Kulkarni. The punchy song has lyrics with typical Vizag lingo and is picturised on Naga Chaitanya’s character, Poorna. The lyrics, tune and vocals seem reminiscent of Tollywood numbers in early 2000s.

Second on the album is Yazin Nizar and Nikhita Gandhi’s Naa Gundello with Rambabu Gosala’s lyrics. The breezy romantic track is a delight to listen to, with Yazin and Nikhita’s vocals standing out. Gopi Sundar too does a good job with the music, bringing in the kind of playfulness the lyrics need.

Kaala Bhairava and Nikhita Gandhi’s Yedetthu Mallele with Shiva Nirvana’s lyrics is the star of this album. It stands out not just due to Bhairava and Nikhita’s vocals but also Gopi Sundar’s music which seems to breathe life into the number. But Shiva Nirvana’s poetic lyrics which talk about the pain of separation and the folksy tune, truly elevate the number. The minimalistic tone of all these elements together makes the song stand out.


Next up is Chinmayi’s delightful Priyathama Priyathama, another standout in the album, penned by Chaitanya Prasad. While the music is undoubtedly a major draw in this one, Chinmayi’s beautiful vocals and Chaitanya’s poetic lyrics that talk of unrequited love make this one a phenomenal track. The song is also a delight to hum along to, with its peppy vibe.


Revanth’s One Boy One Girl offers a balance to the album, bringing in a kind of light-heartedness the previous tracks lacked. Bhaskarbhatla’s catchy lyrics, Gopi Sundar’s foot-tapping music and the tune make this a fun number despite it technically being a ‘heartbreak number’. Fun to hum along and listen to, this one works in lieu of the typical massy numbers Tollywood usually offers.


Bringing the album to a close is Ye Manishike Majiliyo with Vanamali’s lyrics and Arun Gopan, Chinmayi Sripada and Baby Anusha’s vocals. The lyrics which talk of misunderstood love is a fun number to listen to, even if it has nothing much to write home about. The tune, music, vocals and lyrics of this one are plain okay, compared to the rest of the numbers on this album, even veering on the melodramatic side.


Gopi Sundar, who had previously composed for Ninnu Kori seems to have done his best for Shiva Nirvana’s sophomore film too. The album of Majili is a musically rich one, with the songs definitely having the potential to be your next favourite number. However, while the album offers a mixed bag, with something there for everyone, Yedetthu Mallele and Priyathama Priyathama are the clear winners. Give this one a chance this weekend; you might just end up falling in love with some of the songs."
