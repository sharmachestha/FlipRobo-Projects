      "Sivakarthikeyan reminds me of Rajini sir: Isha\n",
      "Jyothi Prabhakar\n",
      "Movies\n",
      "Eighteen years have been kind to her; those who saw Isha Koppikar that many years ago in En Swasa Kaatre, opposite Arvind Swami, will recognise her in a jiffy even now. Tell her that, and she sasses back, “Nothing has changed here either. Same people, same city, same attitude… everything’s the same even now.” And this sets the tone for a then-and-now chat with her. Prompt with her answers, candid, with a healthy dose of self-praise thrown in, Isha tells why she stopped acting in Tamil films, why she’s, for the lack of a better word, making a ‘comeback’ with Sivakarthikeyan’s movie with Ravi Kumar as a femme fatale, and what she’s been up to in all these years…\n",
      "A film with Sivakarthikeyan, no less!\n",
      "This project has been on for almost a year now. Last August, we had one schedule, then the January one this year got delayed and fell into February. We have one in September now.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, a comeback?\n",
      "I guess, yeah, you can call it that. Two years ago, I stepped into the south industry again with the Telugu movie Keshava, then did Looti in Kannada, I have another one lined up with Shivaraj sir… word got around and Ravi Kumar got in touch with me for this one, saying he has a role he wanted me to play. I played a cop in all of the movies mentioned above, but this one was full-on action, kind of Lara Croft-ish, and that got me interested.\n",
      "A lot has changed in 18 years, has it?\n",
      "Nothing has changed — I don’t know whether this is good or bad. But there still are no heroine-centric roles down south, no experimentation, the same kind of stories. New-age cinema seems to have flown right over Tamil cinema. In Bollywood, we now have films that are with the times, like Gully Boy, there are small-budget films that have done exceedingly well — that Vicky Donor wave that brought in Shubh Mangal Saavdhan, Bareilly Ki Barfi, Badhaai Ho… almost all of Ayushmann Khurrana’s films should have made people down south think about upgrading the art of movie making, but no… we’re in love with stereotypes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The stars?\n",
      "Oh, they too! They too! Arvind Swami is still around, Vijay is still at the top… when I focused back on south, I realised all my co-stars of 18 years ago are the one still rocking.\n",
      "\n",
      "The going was good for you back then. Why did you leave?\n",
      "I was studying. All of 15, just out of school, and I come from a family of doctors and educated people. So my dad said nothing doing. You must complete your graduation, or you are not stepping out of the house for anything. He said just in case your acting career doesn’t work out, you must have something to fall back upon. Well, that’s the system we live in, so I could hardly argue. So, I went on to complete BSc in Life Sciences. But between that, coming down south to do movies wasn’t possible. I kept modelling and doing music videos in Bombay, as I could juggle that because it was right there. The boarding, lodging, the distance meant I couldn’t juggle the schedules of Tamil films with that same ease. And when I turned 21, was done with studies and all, it was too late, I was well-settled in Mumbai.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, you are a mom. And the industry, especially down south, isn’t known to be fascinated with that ilk…\n",
      "Yeah, I feel that; all the time. But not explicitly, not yet. I mean no one has said that to my face. Of course, Ramya Krishnan has done a great job with her career – she’s continued right through marriage and all. But when people here look at me, the first reaction is, ‘How have you maintained yourself so well?’ They’re surprised that I am still in shape despite marriage and childbirth. I tell them if you want to be in show business, you better look good!\n",
      "\n",
      "They tell you you’re hot?\n",
      "That’s the common refrain. ‘My God, you still look awesome.’ It makes me feel great. All the carbs I have not eaten all these years is at last making me feel it was all worth it. But I am amazed how I have been welcomed here — with grace and aplomb.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, what are you doing in this Sivakarthikeyan movie?\n",
      "It’s something not seen before here. We have not had the concept of a well-etched out ‘alien’ in Tamil cinema before this. Even in Bollywood, there was Jaadu in Koi... Mil Gaya, that’s it. And even that was more of prosthetics. But this film is all about CG. It’s almost as if two films are being made — one on computer and CG, and one that we are physically shooting.\n",
      "\n",
      "Any old friends? Favourite stars?\n",
      "I meet old, and new ones, too. Favourite stars… Arvind Swami is my all-time favourite because I have worked with him. And I used to be quite fond of Ajith back then — I don’t know if he’s still around, though…\n",
      "\n",
      "And Sivakarthikeyan, your current co-star?\n",
      "He reminds me so much of a younger version of Rajini sir that sometimes I am taken aback.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why? Does he emulate Rajinikanth?\n",
      "No, it’s not because of his mannerisms, or anything. I am not saying he’s consciously trying to emulate Rajini sir, but it’s there. Maybe the hair, the face, the look in the eye, the colour… Something.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are so many Bollywood heroines trying to make a mark down south now. Will you find your niche?\n",
      "But there is no action heroine down south, yet. And I fit the bill — I play the femme fatale in this one, and I look like that. Even if I say so myself, I know that I am versatile. People look at my role in Shabri and say, oh, de-glam. But truth is I was made to look de-glam with heavy makeup because I know that I look good without any makeup, too. I used to spend hours scrubbing off all that during Shabri. I also love these kind of dancing and action roles, too. I am a black belt in Taekwondo, and I still practise twice a week, fitness is a passion with me, and that helps.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the language?\n",
      "I am good with languages. I can grasp easily, plus, I used to chant Sanskrit mantras when I was young, and that helps with the pronunciation. I encourage all of them on the set to speak to me in Tamil.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, when you have to emote in a strange language, or that chemistry with a co-star you’ve never heard of before, how does that happen?\n",
      "The emoting isn’t tough — happiness and sadness have no language. About the co-star, yea, I still don’t know anything about Sivakarthikeyan personally. But thankfully, there’s no love between us in the movie. I am the killing machine and all full of hatred! I look glam, and hot and am the femme fatale. So thankfully, no love and chemistry.\n",
      "\n",
      "Have you travelled much down south?\n",
      "I’ve been to Tirupati, and the other day, on the way to the shooting spot, on OMR, I saw all these shoe stores so we zipped in there. I love food from Saravana Bhavan, and Krishna Sweets – I take their mysorepak for the whole city when I go back. (laughs)\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What else — what have you been up to all these years?\n",
      "I’m a full-time mother, now, have a hospitality business, production house, and am also into politics now, having joined the BJP.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Why politics?\n",
      "I believe we need a strong leader, strict rules and laws. We Indians work only under pressure. If we are told ‘if you don’t do this, you’ll be penalised’, we will do it. We need to be forced into compliance, and hence need strict ruling. Look at all our scriptures, for instance. Most of what’s in them are scientific, but how did they make us follow them? By putting the fear of God in us — ‘If you don’t do this, something bad will happen’…\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "But there are so many stars out there as politicians…\n",

      "If you think children’s stories are mostly about chocolate factories and Cinderella, a new play is here to prove you wrong. City-based group Theatre Dots is opening a sequel to its well-received drama, Act or Not to Act, in the city this weekend. The new piece, titled Say No to Plays, is filled with scenes of laughter and a few awkward and serious moments. It scrutinises 15 reasons to make one think twice before auditioning for a play.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Primarily divided in two parts, the play features as many as 30 young artistes, who are constantly in pressure to meet the expectations of their parents while pursuing their dream in performing arts. Obsession and addiction are among the themes that are explored in the course of the play. Six monologues comprise the first half of the performance, while the second half dabbles in questions like what is more important — the depth or prominence of an actor in a scene, or how much he/she has actually enjoyed enacting it,” explains Pooja Singh, writer and director of the play.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Loosely based on an American play series, Say No to Plays “offers a glimpse into teenagers’ private thoughts”. The story aims at making one introspect about the amount of pressure that is mounted on kids. The 80-minute show also includes an original track, the lyrics of which are written by Pooja, and music is composed by two students. It is being staged at Rangasthala auditorium, Rangoli Metro Art Center on March 3.\n",

      "When Yajamana, produced by Media House Studio, hits theatres today, fans of Challenging Star Darshan will have reason to rejoice, as it brings him back to the big screen after a year-and-a-half. The film, directed by V Harikrishna and P Kumar, pairs Darshan with Rashmika Mandanna and has actors like Tanya Hope, Devaraj, Dhananjaya, P Ravi Shankar and Thakur Anoop Singh, as part of its ensemble cast. Here, Darshan tells us what makes his film a must-watch.\n",
      "\n",
      "“For starters, I want to clarify that we have not set out to do anything extraordinary. Yajamana is a clean entertainer with the right amounts of action, comedy, romance and drama that will appeal to family audiences. Apart from the fact that it is my film, Yajamana has a strong story and message for society. Cinematographer Sreesha Kuduvalli’s visuals are a highlight and the two tones he has used in different parts of the film are noteworthy. The songs by Harikrishna are an added bonus. Most importantly, you will see a variation in my dialogue delivery,” says Darshan.\n",

Slide and tear a big paper towel and attach it to the bottom of your regular wiper - lock it well to the corner too so it doesn't move. Now spray slight water on it or any disinfectant.

      "On Wednesday afternoon, singer Chinmayi Sripada tweeted to Union Minister for Women and Child Development Maneka Gandhi and National Commission for Women (NCW), highlighting that no action has been taken after she named Vairamuthu as her predator in the #MeToo movement. She wrote, “Maam, it’s been 4 months since I named Mr Vairamuthu as my predator. I have since then been banned from work in the TN Film Industry (Dubbing Union). The law as of today doesn’t allow me to file a case. Please give me a solution. @PMOIndia (Sic).” Soon after, Maneka Gandhi replied to her, “I have taken up your case with@NCWIndia. Kindly DM your contact details.” Talking to us, the singer says, “I’m grateful that she responded this time. I’m waiting to see if this will lead to something. The NCW has been given complaints before. They just need to take cognizance of complaints and set up an enquiry commission. They could have easily set up a fact-finding committee and called us and the offenders for an enquiry. We don’t know whose door to knock on. So many playback singers have anonymously taken names of their offenders, but since there’s no action, they are not willing to speak up. Solli enna aaga poradhu? Unakku edhavadhu aacha? (What will happen with sharing our story? Did anything happen from your case?) — that’s what they ask. I hope there is a positive outcome now at least.”\n",

      "Sruthi hopeful with this move\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, Kannada actress Sruthi Hariharan, who had come forth with her #MeToo ordeal against actor-filmmaker Arjun Sarja sees this as a significant step. “Chinmayi has been relentless in her pursuit for the #MeTooIndia movement. She has not only stood her ground and fought her case, but has helped many others share their case. I am glad that she tagged Maneka Gandhi and the Prime Minister’s office in her tweet, because she finally got a reply. There are many cases that have gone to the NCW, so this is a start and I am hoping something comes out of it and people realise that this is something that needs to be taken seriously,” she says.\n",

      "Unlike Chinmayi, who hadn’t got support from the Tamil Nadu State Women’s Commission, Sruthi did in Karnataka, she says. “The women’s commission had filed a suo moto case, as well as one in the cyber crime cell based on the obscene messages that I received on phone and on social media,” explains Sruthi, who adds that she is currently waiting for the next hearing of the case she has filed against Arjun in a court of law.\n",

      "Priyanka Dasgupta\n",
      "Movies\n",
      "Does it take away anything from a director’s accolades if he acknowledges a source? Does the stature of a director dip if he shares the writing credits? Does it cost a lot to pay a few lakhs to procure rights of Bengali novels/short stories?The answer is a big No.\n",
      "That’s something Anurag Kashyap understood when he directed Dev.D. He went to town to acknowledge that he was making a modern-day adapatation of Saratchandra Chattopadhyay novel. No one would have dragged him to court had he not mentioned that. Yet, Anurag spoke about his Saratchandra connection. In our own backyard, Buddhadab Dasgupta directed Dooratwa from Sirshendu Mukherjee’s work. His Tahader Katha was based on Kamal Kumar Majumdar’s story by the same name. While his Uttara was adapted from Samaresh Basu’s work, Charachar was an adaptation of a Prafulla Roy work. More recently, when Aparna Sen directed Arshinagar with Dev as Ranajit Mitra and Rittika Sen as Julekha Khan, she mentioned it was a musical adaptation of William Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately, there are many who find it too difficult to credit a source. That’s why plagiarism charges have been levelled by fans and family members of authors like Moti Nandi, Atin Bandopadhyay and Suchitra Bhattacharya, among others. In some cases, the similarities are coincidental. In others, there is a lot more than that.\n",
      "The problem is the culture of silence. Most authors don’t protest for fear of problems. But, they crib in privacy while expecting the world around to fight for their rights. Directors, meanwhile, happily ruin the chances of official adaptation rights being sold to those willing to credit.\n",

      "Works of Rabindranath Tagore, Satyajit Ray, Saratchandra Chattopadhyay, Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay, Saradindu Bandopadhyay, Bibhutibushan Bandopadhyay or Tarashankar Bandopadhyay have largely been credited. When Manas read the three-page Bibhutibushan story titled Taal Nabami, he added some characters and finally, made the 90-minute-long Sahaj Paather Gappo. “It is all about an individual’s ethics. To each his own. For me, giving credit — however little I take from a novel or story — is my duty and responsibility,” says Manas.\n",

      "IS IT AN EGO ISSUE?\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps, ego plays an important role. “Even Sunil Gangopadhyay was not spared. An internationally-reputed director had lifted some portions from his Shei Samay while making a movie. Not just films, Bengali serials too have cases where the original writers weren’t credited. A few years back, Atin Bandopadhyay’s Neel Kantha Pakhir Khonje was telecast as a popular serial without acknowledging him. Such controversies were unheard of with directors like Ray, Ghatak or Mrinal Sen. Today’s Tollywood directors try to place themselves in a position which does not rightfully belong to them. They also ignore the financial aspect,” says author Prabal Kumar Basu.\n",

      "Some directors also end up measuring the extent of the inspiration. But that’s not the point, insists Buddhadeb. “I adapted Mondo Meyer Upakhyan from Prafulla Roy’s short story by the same name. I made Grihajuddha from Dibyendu Palit’s Maach. I made Tope from Narayan Gangopdhyay’s work. In all these cases, I changed a lot from the original works. Trust me, it takes away nothing from a director’s skill if the writing credit goes to someone else. Nobody thought of me as any less of a director for adapting Maach,” says Buddhadeb. This “first-boy syndrome”, he says, is doing harm to the industry. “It’s not that great movies are being made when sources remain undisclosed,” adds Buddhadeb.\n",

Many don’t realise that Bengal still has a fair share of bookworms who can easily identify sources. Some years ago, authors like Sirshendu Mukherjee and Debesh Roy had written to Bangladesh’s information ministry to protest when plagiarism charges were levelled on the makers of Brihannala in Bangladesh for copying Syed Mustafa Siraj’s Gachta Bolecilo. Subsequently, the Bangladesh government cancelled three national film awards bestowed upon Brihannala. Abhijit Siraj, the author’s son, says, “This wouldn’t have happened without a protest.

Also, many said Khaad bore resemblances with a film. That’s why I had given the post.” Chakraborty attributed the similarities with a few common sources. “I spoke to several people and also did field survey while penning the story; chances are, Kaushik Ganguly spoke to the same people. If Kaushik today says he hasn’t read my book, I won’t be able to say he’s lying,” said the author.\n",

      "Chakraborty, who says the credits appeared on the screen for a fleeting two seconds, said it could have lingered on for a bit more time. “While writing my novel, I spoke to Manabi Bandopadhyay, among others. She gave me valuable inputs. Looks like, she has provided a lot of matter to Kaushik too. But at the end of it, it’s a love story that mine is not. Having said that, I will never disrespect the views of those who pointed out the similarities.” Said Kaushik, “What he had said was out of his concerns about his novel. Though it’s sad that he couldn’t keep faith in me, I am grateful that he finally watched the film and revised his statement. But I’m far more worried about those who aren’t Swapnamoy Chakraborty and made one post after another on social media. During mob violence, the target is sometimes tied to the lamppost and even passers-by, without knowing what is happening, pelt stones at him. Social media has become a violent place. The ones writing against me are those for whom I make films. And every story of mine can be similar to another story happening in some part of the world. I write stories out of my own experiences and another person may be going through the same at some point in time. All I want to say is, think before you act. For tomorrow, you may have to regret for what you are\n",

      "Divya Kaushik\n",
      "Bollywood\n",
      "The response that she got since the release of her film 'Pink' two years ago has helped Taapsee Pannu find her footing in the industry. The actress, who is now looking forward to the release of her next, Sujoy Ghosh’s thriller 'Badla', with Amitabh Bachchan, says, “A lot of things happened between 'Pink' and 'Badla' that validated my choices and made me a more confident actor. When 'Pink' happened, I did not know which way my career was going to go. I was trying and testing different films to see where my calling was and when 'Pink' released, it gave me a direction. After that, I was sure of one thing – that I would always take up roles which are part of the main storyline. I mean, if you take out this character from the film, the story will not be the same. The other thing is that I want to play a woman with a spine, because I can connect personally to it and that helps me perform better. The audience response to my work has sort of validated my choice of films.” Taapsee, who was in her hometown Delhi recently, adds that like her previous roles, in 'Badla', she is again playing a strong woman who stands her ground and is confident. She adds, “The character I am playing is pretty confident from the beginning itself. You will not see her vulnerable side, and you won’t see her as someone who would think she is helpless. She knows very well what she wants, she is borderline arrogant because she has made everything for herself from scratch in a foreign land. She has this thing in her mind that no matter what, I will manoeuvre my way out of any situation. She has appointed this lawyer, played by Mr Bachchan in the film. She has hired this man to fight her case, and she has that control over the person she has employed. Like Sujoy’s female characters in his other films like 'Kahaani', this one too is extremely powerful.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Though Taapsee agrees that there are few examples of good, edge-of-the-seat thrillers in Bollywood, she feels that 'Badla' won’t disappoint. “One can’t think of many good thrillers in Bollywood. 'Kahaani' was a good thriller, so was 'Gupt'. Thriller is one of the oldest genres of cinema, but these days, people are not touching it much. The reason could be that it is a very tricky genre, at any point, if your audience can predict the end, your film has fallen flat. You have to keep the audience so engrossed that they are not able to predict the end. Even if you leave theatre for 30 seconds while watching 'Badla', you won’t understand what has happened, you won’t be able to connect the dots,” says Taapsee, who will be sharing screen space with Bachchan again in 'Badla' after 'Pink'. “My confidence level was surely different this time when I worked with him. After 'Pink', I share a certain comfort level in working with him, but even in 'Pink' working with him was never intimidating for me. I am not a very star-struck person, may be because of the fact that I didn’t grow up obsessing over films. I had seen Mr Bachchan’s films while having lunch or dinner with family, but it’s not like I have grown in awe of all the actors. I only get intimidated when I am with a bunch of extremely talented actors, where I know I am not a trained actor, which happened in 'Mulk' with me. But I enjoy working with Mr Bachchan. People think I must be blanking out when I look into his eyes and perform, but I actually get excited,” she says.\n",

      "You may as well call it 50 shades of pink. For, this hue can be seen in so many variations — baby pink, light millennial pink, coral, soft shell enamel, fuchsia, and more. And at the recent Oscar Awards it was another shade of the colour that stood out as the most popular fashion trend for the night — bright pink! There was almost a sea of gowns in the hue — in poufy frills, netted ruffles, princess-style trail gowns, bubble-gum hued tulles and more. It’s being described by fashion analysts as ‘joyful’ and ‘what modern couture should be like’. As it upped the sartorial ante, it got fashion pundits asking: Is pink the new black?\n",

She also snuck a cookie into her pockets to probably munch on during the whole event. While Linda Cardellini seemed to pile on pink stylishly, Kacey Musgraves stole it with her cotton-candy-pink tulle net ensemble and Sarah Paulson opted for a billowy, cutout-style fuchsia gown. But it was veteran actress Angela Bassett who was the reigning queen of the night as most sites called her. She turned heads in her exaggerated hot pink shoulder gown with its thigh-high slit and a gem-shaped clutch. Also in close running for wearing the hue stylishly were actresses Helen Mirren and Julia Roberts. Mirren swished in with her frothy pink tulle and Roberts dished up Oscars chic in her flowy-but-fitted one-shouldered bright pink dress with an asymmetrical leg slit. And guess what?

      "While shocking pink and its cousins heated up the red carpet at the Oscars, you can just as easily wear the hue in your daily life. Here are tips to do so:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Pink is the colour for any season — it adds vibrancy to winter and lends a lovely hue to summer. So, go with skater, shift dresses and other styles in it, for the upcoming season.\n",
      "- Yes, this is a pretty shade, but you don’t want to look too girly in it, so break the monotony of the hue with black, navy blue and grey.\n",
      "- Since pink is also a light shade, it is perfect for those ruffles, frills and poufs.\n",
      "- Keep away the stiff, black heels and make pink your new neutral footwear. Opt for pumps, peep toes, kitten heels and stilettos in bright or baby pink.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Planning to wear all-black? Pink comes in as the perfect complement. Wear pink stud earrings or hoops as well a pop pink clutch or quilted bag to go with the rest of the look.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Love athleisure? Weave pink into your gym wear with pink keds, tracks with a neon pink stripe or even a fuchsia top over those black leggings.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Team a pink halter with white jeans for a day outdoors.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Grab a pair of sunnies with a pink frame to complete the look. Dab on the eyeshadow to match.\n",

The wedding was followed by a reception. The celebrations began two days before the wedding with a sangeet ceremony, which had performances by the bride and groom and their families. Since all the naach-gaana had happened on the sangeet, the wedding and the reception were formal affairs. musical bonding: It was their common interest in music that brought Bhavana and Dennis together. Dennis is a drummer and is based in Los Angeles. His family and friends flew down from LA to attend the wedding and were surprised to see the “long, but extremely beautiful wedding.” The groom’s mother, Birgitta Nilsson, said, “The weddings that I have attended didn’t last longer than 20 minutes, but the ceremony here was almost 90 minutes long and that was new for us. We enjoyed everything about this traditional wedding, it has been a great experience.” Kaushalya Reddy told us that during the wedding ceremony, when the priest asked the groom which god he believes in, he replied, “If there is one god I believe in, it is the god of music.”\n",

      "Events\n",
      "A documentary performance titled Lady Anandi, recently performed at Baudh Sansthan, was well received by the audience. The play was written and performed by Anuja Ghosalkar, a Bangalore-based artist, in three different languages Hindi, English and Marathi. Even though not many in the audience understood the Marathi dialogues, the scenes were well applauded by all because of Anuja’s powerful performance.\n",
      "The one-woman show revolved around an actress who is haunted by the ghost of her great-grandfather, a late 19th century female impersonator.\n",
      "Chief guest Naresh Saxena, a well-known poet, also enjoyed the play.\n",
      "\n",
      "The play concluded with a 15 minutes question and answer session in which the keen audience participated with great enthusiasm. \"Though the documentary form of theatre isn’t very much popular among the theatre lovers in India and is not practiced much here, I am really happy that Lucknowites loved our play,\" said Anuja towards the end of the session.\n",

      "TNN\n",
      "-\n",
      "It usually happens that after reaching the age of 18-20 years, an autistic individual no more receives the kind of educational support that is offered at a younger age. Apart from certain specific training programmes, the individual is often excluded from other help. While education remains a life-long process for everyone else, a large number of autistic individuals are deprived of it at an early age,” says artist and art consultant Sneha Joshi, who is curating Eye Contact: An insight into autism — a special event in Bengaluru.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the primary goal of the initiative is to raise awareness about the developmental disorder, help erase the stigma around it and make art more accessible to autistic individuals, the event —which comprises an exhibition, a performance and a panel discussion — also aims at forming a more inclusive society that embraces marginalised communities and help them thrive. “We want to take conversations about autism to public places and open forums, where people can participate and discuss issues and possible solutions. This would not only enable young adults suffering from this disorder express themselves, but also create a comfort zone for them to identify their inherent talents and showcase them,” explains Sneha, who has an autistic brother. Family narratives as well as personal experiences of caretakers are other focus areas of the initiative. According to Sneha, art and media can be instrumental in making society more inclusive. The event will be conducted by Colours Centre for Learning, in association with The Be A Smile Project — a research project investigating autism and society. It’s taking place from April 5-7 at Rangoli – Metro Art Centre.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The showcase will include paintings, video work, pictures, as well as interactive activities for visitors. The artists participating in the exhibition include Dattaprasad Sawardekar, Kajal Ashar, Sachin Joshi and Tanisha Lahiri. The funds collected through the initiative will be used for the remuneration of the artists and for the development of an arts training centre for the autistic individuals. The movement arts performance — which is an adaptation of Mark Haddon’s The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time — is crafted by contemporary dancer-choreographer Priyabrat Panigrahi.\n",

      "TNN\n",
      "Music\n",
      "We had told you previously about how Bengaluru’s walking violinist Aneesh Vidyashankar had collaborated with rapper-musician All.OK for a cover of the latter’s song Yaakinge. Now, Aneesh’s latest cover, which sees him re-create the hugely popular Punjabi dance pop number Lamberghini, is making quite the stir online. In fact, the original makers of the song, which includes musicians The Doorbeen and singer Ragini, have expressed their pleasure on listening to the cover. “I have a friend, who goes by the name Bren Garage on social media, who is an automobile enthusiast and has some exclusive limited edition super cars. Inspired by the allusion in the song Lamberghini, we decided to shoot a video that just showcases the mean machine that he owns,” says Aneesh, adding that the video was first uploaded by Bren on Instagram, which saw a lot of good feedback, including the original musicians. “We have since been approached by the record label that released the song and they’ve released the song on their channel on video sharing sites,” he says. Aneesh is already set for his next collaboration. “When I was on the Kannada television show Majaa Talkies, I played a version of Nana Mele Nanageega from Krishi Thapanda’s film Kannadakkaagi Ondannu Otti, which she loved. We are now collaborating for the same and doing a video soon,” he tells us. The two shot for the video last evening and it is slated for a release next week, the musician tells us. “These cover songs are a good way to get people to notice the intrument. And I always give it a classical, Indian spin to whatever I do,” he adds.\n",

      "After Bigg Boss Kannda season 5 winner and Kannada rapper Chandan Shetty was roped in to create awareness on voting, runner-up of the last season of Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Hanumantha has been appointed as the brand ambassdaor of SVEEP of Haveri district to create awareness on voting. Hanumantha who is not a trained singer showcased his singing skills on the popular singing show Sa Re Ga Ma pa.\n",
      "Hanumantha rose to fame after participating in the television realtiy show Sa Re Ga Ma Pa. Hanumantha who is a shepherd by profession is now getting plenty of offers in Sandalwood. The performance of Hanumantha won him appreciation from judges Hamsalekha, Rajesh Krishnan, Vijay Prakash and Arjun Janya.\n",

      "Vellai Pookal is a unique film, says Vivekh\n",
      "TNN\n",
      "Movies\n",
      "Many ‘new’ comedians have made a mark for themselves in Kollywood of late and are doing back-to-back films. But Vivekh’s comedy, which often touches upon social causes, still remains the favourite of many Kollywood film buffs. The veteran actor, who still gives young comedians a run for their money, thanks to his spontaneity and thought-provoking one-liners, is gung-ho about his upcoming projects, among which he considers Vellai Pookal to be unique. In a freewheeling chat withus, he talks about topics that include movies, nature conservation, sexual crimes, caste system, and more...\n",
      "Looks like Vellai Pookal isn’t ‘your kind of film’. You are playing a serious cop and have sported salt ‘n’ pepper looks, too…\n",
      "It all started when the film’s director Vivek Elangovan, a US-based Microsoft engineer, approached me with a story. But I was skeptical about the project even materialising when the makers said they wanted me to go to the US. They needed my dates for a month and asked me to go to Seattle. Later, they sent me the summary of the film, but I said I need the entire script, which has details of every scene irrespective of the number of scenes I’m a part of. After going through it, I felt this is a script which someone who has Sathyaraj sir’s physique and screen presence would do justice to. But they convinced me by saying that audience will be prepared to watch certain scenes with actors who have not done such roles before. I play a retired DIG (Intelligence) who goes to the US to meet his son, with whom he has had a difference of opinion. Audience expect comedy from me, so I had reservations initially. But then, I felt this is the right time to try something different. Our viewers are yearning for novelty these days and they appreciate honest and innovative attempts.\n",
      "\n",
      "How has the industry reacted to your makeover?\n",
      "Many of them loved it. AR Rahman has always been a good friend of mine. I showed him the teaser and he was impressed by it. I asked him if he could do music and he said he has his hands full. We told him that we can wait till he gets sometime from his hectic schedule. Though we waited for a year, he couldn’t do it because of his busy assignments.\n",
      "There is an influx of thrillers in Kollywood now. How is this film going to be different?\n",
      "The good thing is all these films were received well, which is an advantage for our project, too. Our film has lot of mind games and edge-of-the-seat moments with ample emotions. Though most artistes in it are from the US, Charlie, Pooja Devariya and newbie Dev have interesting roles in it.\n",
      "\n",
      "What are your other projects?\n",
      "These days, many seem to be embracing agriculture. I have been thinking about a movie on farming and related stuff and am currently writing a script — it needs a commercially viable hero. I will be directing the movie, too, which will have humour as its main attraction, though the content discussed in it will be quite serious and relevant.\n",
      "\n",
      "You are teaming up with Vijay after a long time in Atlee’s upcoming film.\n",
      "We are teaming up after more than a decade. Kuruvi was the last film we did together. He had called me up recently and said that he’s happy to join hands with me again. Vijay told me “we should rock” and Atlee is keen on portraying me in a jovial role. I’m excited to join the team soon.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was news on you teaming up with Sivakarthikeyan\n",
      "That was actually news for me as well. Siva had once said that I’m his inspiration for doing comedy. I would love to do a movie with him.\n",
      "\n",
      "You had a small role in Viswasam which went on to become one of the top grossing films in the state\n",
      "I’m so happy the movie did well. Siva approached me and said that my role comes only in the second half. He said there are scenes where I have to make fun of Ajith’s character and that I would be the best person for the same. We had some beautifully shot scenes, but couldn’t retain it. There is a scene where I utter his popular dialogue “en vazhkaila ovvoru naalum ovvoru nimishamum yen ovvoru nodiyaiyum naana sedhukkunadhu da” to him, to which he gives a funny counter. Fans would have loved that scene has it been retained. It was a pleasure to work again with Nayanthara after a decade, as well.\n",

      "Are there any recent movies from which you enjoyed comedy thoroughly?\n",
      "There are many and it would be difficult to choose a few among them. The style of comedy in cinema has now changed. The average duration of a movie was more than 2.30 hours when Vadivelu and I used to have separate comedy tracks. Now people are impatient and can’t sit through a movie which is more than two hours. Even when watching movies of lesser duration, they get sidetracked with mobile videos and messages on phone. So, we comedians do not get so much of time to create an impact. People who perform in Tik Tok and YouTube channels have more followers these days because they have the liberty to take as much as time they want to. It’s difficult to perform full-fledged comedy like how I did in films like Saamy, Kadhal Sadugudu, Uthamaputhiran, Maapillai, Padikkathavan, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "Is there a movie after watching which you felt disappointed not being a part of it?\n",
      "I was in talks with the veteran filmmaker KC Bokadia for a political film which had good dose of humour. That was around the time LKG and NOTA were announced, and went on floors. And so Bokadia’s film was scrapped. But after watching LKG, I felt we should have gone ahead with our movie as well. Our project would also have been liked by audience.\n",

      "Looks like we are heading towards a scorching summer this year. As a nature enthusiast, do you think we are taking our natural resources for granted?\n",
      "I have now completed planting 30.23 lakh saplings and have 70 lakh more to complete the mission given by the beloved Abdul Kalam sir. I have always been vocal about preserving water and living a nature-friendly life. Many homes here haven’t received metro water for a long time. People are slowly realising that depending on AC while staying indoors will not work. In places like Pudukottai and other delta areas, you get bore water only after digging 2,000 ft deep. Of late, many people talk about the need to provide water to birds. The unfortunate fact is that human beings are also running short of water. At least five trees should be planted for every tree which is cut down.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "To what extent do you think the #MeToo movement has created an impact in the film industry here?\n",
      "I think awareness has been created now. Our culture has always been about treating women as mothers. It is sad that women are treated as mere sex objects by many. Even small children are being sexually abused. Sexual perversion, frustration and depression are turning people into beasts. Only stringent punishment can control such incidents. When an accused gets bail easily and such cases take years to get a verdict, people aren’t really worried about the law. The easy access to pornography is another reason why, I think, there is an increase in the number of such crimes. We never had so many shocking crimes two or three decades ago. In such cases, 25 per cent is due to the influence of cinema and 75 per cent because of unlimited access to pornography.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "As a socially-conscious person what do you think are things which require urgent attention?\n",
      "We need self-sufficient farmers, massive planting of trees, innovative ways to conserve water and proper education. Education is the key to abolishing caste system. There was a time I felt such discrimination is coming to an end, but sadly, it has only come up all over again in the recent times. Even in today’s age of WhatsApp, Facebook, latest gadgets and communication facilities, people are discussing caste and using these apps to instigate communal riots.\n",

I can’t even afford to take a break from my tight schedule. I feel working on your birthday is lucky, so I didn’t plan a party. I was really surprised by this sweet gesture of my friends.

      "TNN\n",
      "Bollywood\n",
      "He’s the guy who rages and roars on screen, ripping apart the wrong doers with deadly vengeance that makes you shudder and scream, but it feels real. He walks through the walls and doors, with every sinew in that 100-kilo body, throbbing with energy. And be forewarned, you can’t mess with the man in real life, too. He doesn’t mince words when he says, “It is very difficult to tell me lies and get away with it. There is nothing that will get past me.” His action avatar aside, what John really loves delving into is history and world politics, and understanding how all of that impacts human lives. In a chat with BT, the actor excitedly talks about his upcoming spy thriller, 'RAW (Romeo, Akbar, Walter)', a story that’s inspired by true events from the 1971 Indo-Pak war, his views on social media activism and how he will always stand up and speak his mind, through his stories on celluloid. Read on...\n",
      "Stories that stem from real incidents and significant episodes in history have always interested you ('Madras Café', 'Parmanu: The Story Of Pokhran', and the upcoming 'Batla House'). So, what clinched it specifically for 'RAW'? Also, the mood of the country is different now from what it was a year ago, post the heinous Pulwama attack. Hence, films with a political backdrop need to be doubly sure that they are touching the right chord with the audience. Would you agree?\n",
      "I read the script and I wanted to do it, I knew this was a fantastic story. I was fortunate that Robbie Grewal (writer-director) approached me, though he didn’t expect me to do it. The minute I heard it, I was floored and the first thing I told him was that this is not flaky stuff; the film is so well-researched. Robbie has grown up in an army background; his father was part of the military intelligence, so the subject is close to his heart. Both Robbie and I are intrinsically India lovers. The good thing is that this film is not jingoistic or overtly patriotic. It does not get into the zone of bashing other countries, it is a thriller. Just like 'Raazi', which was after all a human story, this one is, too. Unfortunately for us, the film is releasing post the Pulwama attacks. It has been in the making for a year. In fact, it was always meant to release between March 15 and April 12, you can find it mentioned in the industry trade magazines. We pushed the date ahead to April 5. We know that unfortunately, the film resonates with the mood of the country, but it’s not pre-planned.\n",
      "\n",
      "'RAW' is inspired by true events, and set against the backdrop of the Indo-Pak war of 1971. How much have you personally researched the events that happened during that period? And while doing that, did it throw up interesting insights and give you a different perspective on the subject?\n",
      "When I hear stories about wars from people in general, they mostly come from a space of ignorance, pardon me for saying this. In this case, a huge amount of research has gone into the film; I give all credit to Robbie for it. On my part, I think the fact that I am politically aware and I know what has historically happened in the world around us, helps while telling such stories. Subjects like 'Madras Café', 'Parmanu: The Story Of Pokhran', 'Batla House' and 'RAW' is the space that I dwell in. We shot this film in Kashmir, in the middle of a shootout that happened during Eid. We know and understand the mood of the region and are aware of the history of what has happened there for a long time. When you make a film on a sensitive subject, you have to be very responsible in your storytelling. You cannot fudge anything, or take creative liberties, it has to be factual. My biggest source of information was of course, Robbie and all that he had gathered from his father. Other than that, I have read numerous books on the pre-Partition and post-Partition eras. I generally read a lot on such subjects, so if you ask me about what’s happening in Syria, Ecuador, Venezuela or any other part of the world, I am well-informed. I like understanding why there is conflict, where it is coming from and what is the root of it all. You understand all this, process it, and then, when you read Twitter hashtags that tell you… say yes to this, say no to that, I feel bad. You need to have the right information before Tweeting and commenting on such serious issues.\n",
      "Yes, social media commentary is common these days and it is often misleading. There is no dearth of armchair activists on social media platforms, people who have an opinion on most issues and dole out advice on various subjects. There are some who genuinely make an impact, but a huge number of them say things out of line to simply draw attention…\n",
      "I would say that it is dangerous. If you are saying something that is sensitive, you rather not say it if you are not backed by the knowledge to comment on the subject. The most dangerous thing in this world is low IQ and high confidence. It can’t get worse than that.\n",
      "\n",
      "While you might have strong views on pertinent issues and you are well-informed, one does not see you participating in debates, discussions, or commenting on burning issues (political, social or otherwise) on such forums...\n",
      "I keep telling people that I am not in the business of trending on social media. I do not want to be in a space where I have to be in the news and say something exceptional that will trend. In our line of work, things have changed so much. Earlier, a producer would take you to a hoarding in Juhu and tell you, ‘Look, here is where you are’. Now, the same producer says, ‘Look, you are trending at number one and you are tracking so well’. It might make some actors happy, but I have seen film promotions that have got the fastest 100 million views online, but then, what’s happened to some of those films after they hit the theatres? I feel that a good film will always find its audience. So, my point is, just make a good film, and don’t worry how it is tracking, trending or anything else.\n",
      "\n",
      "You have backed good films as a producer and made brave choices with movies that went on to make a mark at the box office. Do you think that made industry folks build more faith in you as an actor, too?\n",
      "Yes, people take my word for it and I am very responsible with my words. If I tell a certain studio that this content is good, they take my word for it, as they trust my instinct and know that I would be saying the right thing. I think I have worked hard for that. Ever since I turned producer, I have always gone with my instinct and taken risks. We released 'Parmanu: The Story Of Pokhran' during the IPL semi-finals, it was like committing hara-kiri. I had gone through a court case with the producer (Prerna Arora), but I saw that release through and it taught me a lot. I learnt a lot about the legal process and how things work in court. I learnt a lot about distribution and about everything else under the sun. In some of my interviews during that time, I had said that it is very difficult to tell John lies and get away with it. There is nothing that can fool me or will get past me.\n",
      "\n",
      "You took a strong stand and fought it out in court, and others followed...\n",
      "(Cuts in)… I will always take a stand, even as an actor when I am working on my movies. I am not one of those politically correct actors who is pro-India, but will not say anything that will antagonise anybody. I won’t make a political statement just to trend on social media, but I will say things as they are, as they are meant to be said and I will say it through my films.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "You recently said that looking ahead, you can see your best five years coming up (as an actor and producer). The fact that the audience’s appetite for cinema is growing, actors are getting greedier for better and well-written roles and that there is a plethora of options for actors to choose from, has a huge role to play in the benchmark you have set for your career goals. Right?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, even going ahead, I will only develop content. I will work with the new Ayushmanns (Khurrana) of the world and new directors. I will give them opportunities, and at the end of the day, who will be the hero? The content. Nothing else will drive the film other than good content. I look at it from the audience’s perspective, as I converse a lot with my audience. Why did I become a producer in the first place? For two reasons, firstly, as an actor, I wasn’t getting the kind of films that I wanted to do. Secondly, I wasn’t getting to watch the kind of films I wanted to watch as an audience. If you see my trajectory as an actor before I turned producer and post that, there is a quantum leap. It is because I am doing films which I am convinced that I am meant to do, and I am saying this with all humility. I am a learner, I have learnt through the process. I couldn’t understand the garish performances and overacting that was considered good acting when I first came into the industry, where my subtle acting was considered underacting. People would think, ‘He is not acting’. Today, that subtle acting is considered good. The audience’s tastes have changed and we are at that inflection point, where there is need for content, new-age cinema, subtleties in performances, and everything I am here for.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Even while you are doing these content-heavy films, I assume that you would still want to be seen as Action Abraham, the kickass action hero, right? Also, today, the action in our films has gone notches higher (as far as skill, technique and style are concerned). Do you see it scaling up even further?\n",
      "You could do the best action in this country, but it will not work if you don’t connect emotionally with the story. If the EQ (emotional quotient) is good and the action is average, your film will still do wonders. So, I feel that movies here still run on emotions, not on great action. Think of this…who are your biggest action heroes? Bruce Willis, Sylvester Stallone, Dwayne Johnson, Arnold Schwarzenegger, these are the massive action heroes of Hollywood. What is common between all of them? None of them can really do action…it is their attitude that makes them such huge action heroes. When Arnold says, ‘I will be back’, it’s the way he says it that stays with you. It is the attitude that makes an action hero, not the action itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Given how involved you are in every aspect of filmmaking, you must have given some thought to the idea of turning director, too?\n",
      "Yes, I have. I will direct someday. I get a lot of hope when I see films directed by artistes like Bradley Cooper, Clint Eastwood and Robert Redford. They are actors who are also such fine directors, they inspire me.\n",

      "TNN\n",
      "Bollywood\n",
      "Chuck Russell ‘directed’ a real elephant herd for the first time in his life for 'Junglee'. He tells us that it was very important for him that the elephants were comfortable and happy, which is why he brought no animal trainers along with him for the shoot – the default Hollywood way. Chuck wanted to work only with the elephants and their mahouts, which elicited grim warnings from his Hollywood colleagues. But for the director, the journey which began in fear soon transformed into respect, and then love. “I’ve worked with a guy who’s a legend in Hollywood, Sled Reynolds (animal trainer Paul ‘Sled’ Reynolds) who did 'Tarzan', 'The Ape Man' (1981) with Bo Derek, he did 'The Scorpion King' for me. He was kind of a mentor for me in working with animals, and he told me, ‘Chuck, do not go out there and think you’re the elephant whisperer. They are very dangerous, wild animals’. He wanted me to take some of his trainers with me and he basically made me promise not to get too close to the elephants. Because elephants can kill you accidentally,” says Chuck, and then adds with a chuckle, “I haven’t sent him the trailer yet, ‘coz he’s going to kill me! I did tell him that I wanted to work with the mahouts, and he just... This is the Hollywood thinking, and Sled is a master. But 'Junglee' is a different situation. This is a real herd of elephants, with each having a mahout that stays with his/her elephant for life. So this was a much more naturalistic approach to shooting elephants.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What fears did he bring with him? “From the beginning, I knew it was dangerous,” replies Chuck, “Our protocols were developed one step at a time until I felt it was safe. Vidyut was always at the lead because he’s got his own opinion about what is safe, but around the animals, it was only respect. I didn’t tell them when to work, they told me. We earned their trust first, and then I was amazed at the things that happened between them. So it was a slow process, I was there a couple of weeks before we started filming, Vidyut spent a couple of weeks just with Bhola. And then we brought the rest of the crew in.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He adds, “By the time we were done, we knew what he liked, we knew his apples. Bhola does not let other people approach him. Just his mahout, and Vidyut and fortunately, myself, thanks to the time we spent together. So this was a legit wildlife adventure. I couldn’t do a movie about my love for elephants and the fact that we could lose them, unless the elephants I worked with were truly safe, happy and enjoyed working on our set.”\n",

      "TNN\n",
      "Hindi\n",
      "Hunar Gandhi calls herself a Delhi girl. Her association with the national capital is quite old. The 'Patiala Babes' actress has lived and shot for two shows ('Dahleez' and '12/24 Karol Bagh') in Delhi, and now owns a house in Gurgaon with actor-husband Mayank Gandhi. Although Delhi and Gurgaon are far from similar, to Hunar, it’s all the same. “For those of us who come from Bombay, Gurgaon is Delhi. I still cannot differentiate between the two,” she says, “It has happened so many times that I’d come to our Gurgaon house and someone from my in-laws would say, ‘Main Delhi jaa raha hoon’, and I’d say, ‘Hum Delhi mein hi toh hain’. But now, after spending more time here, I know it’s a separate city.” Hunar laments that she hasn’t explored Gurgaon as much as Delhi. “I know Delhi quite well. I shot in places like Karol Bagh and Chhatarpur, so I know the food and the people very well. But I haven’t had a chance to explore Gurgaon. When I go somewhere new, I always gorge on the city’s food first. The street food shops in Gurgaon will be my first stop.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hunar has some fond memories of shooting in Delhi, particularly the outdoor shoots in Karol Bagh. “I remember we once shot at Ajmal Khan Road with a hidden camera set-up, and it was so fun because people didn’t know we were shooting,” she recounts, adding, “Bas Delhi ki ek baat buri hai. Yahan stalkers bahut aa jaate hain. And I don’t know how, but logon ko yahan phone number bhi badi jaldi mil jaate hain aapke.” On the work front, Hunar’s role of ‘the other woman’ Meeta in 'Patiala Babes', is being appreciated by the audience. She says, “I knew this role had to be different from the usual other women roles you see in soaps, and I’m glad I have been able to bring that out. I wanted her to be a well-rounded human being, and not just shades of black or white. I am happy that it is being appreciated by the audience. When have you ever seen people sympathizing with the other woman in a TV show?”\n",

      "The incident took place around 3.30 am when everyone was asleep. Tannaz shudders as she recalls the incident, “Bhakhtyar and I were sleeping in our room, when our househelp called me from the children’s room, inquiring about the power cut. I asked Bhakhtyar to look into it and within a few minutes of him stepping out, I heard him scream. He is not the one to panic easily. So, I rushed out, and was shocked to see fire in the passage. There were huge flames and smoke reaching inside the house. Fortunately, our neighbour helped us diffuse it by using blankets and kitchen napkins. Bhakhtyar was a real-life hero; he managed to bring the fire down after working relentlessly for 45 minutes. Thankfully, the fire brigade and police also came in time.”\n",

She was recently here again for work when she got talking to us about indulging in some retail therapy in Jaipur, her singing debut, and that she chooses her projects carefully to over-exposure of her voice. Shibani says, “I have mostly come here for shows. Once, I stayed back (after the show) for a day to explore Jaipur and went to Nahargarh Fort, Amber Fort, Jal Mahal and explored the historical side of the city. Jaipur is a fascinating city steeped in history and culture. Every time I come here, it takes me to an epoch of royalty and tradition.

The song addresses the issue of drunken driving. Opening up on her love for independent music, the singer tells us, “I have come from independent music. My debut pop album Ho Gayi Hai Mohabbat is still fresh in people’s memories. It is something that I connect with. Independent music gives me more liberty and freedom to express myself, which I don’t think is the case with Bollywood music. It’s not in your control.”\n",

I feel proud when I hear people singing my song and coming out with their own versions of it. It’s not easy to create a song like Sajna... I have travelled the world because of it. Even after so many years, if I am still identified with Sajna, I take it as a compliment. Having said that, I also want to urge my fans to listen to my other songs as well!”\n",

      "With new singers coming up, fewer opportunities are left for senior artistes, something which singer Shaan had also spoken about earlier. Shibani opines, “I feel, the voices of singers like Shaan or Sonu Nigam are over exposed. And when that happens, the audience gets tired of hearing your voice, which paves the way for new voices. So, I have been careful in choosing my songs.\"\n",

      "TNN\n",
      "-\n",
      "Finding true relationships —friends or lovers — in general, is hard. While you might find a good friend or true lover by hanging out with him or her in person, people often wonder if having a network of contacts on social media, who you have never met, can be called friends, too. Are social media relations as deep and meaningful as long-standing friendships in the real world?\n",
      "\n",
      "With the soaring popularity of such platforms, people tend to communicate less in person and more online. According to a recent American study, 76 per cent teenagers use social media. While some might assume that online relationships are transient, fleeting and shallow, others feel that sometimes you can be more honest with a social media friend, than communicating with someone directly. That’s because, though the mediums are different, the bond you share with someone online is as intense as it would be with someone you meet.\n",
      "“Social media and dating apps are excellent avenues to find new companions. But often, it is equated to finding a friend with benefits. If you find someone who seems genuine, make sure you don’t get physically or financially involved. Be it friendship or love, it’s best to take things slow, initially,” says Dr Rohann Bokdawala, psychiatrist.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trust is the key\n",

They connected on a social networking site via a mutual friend and their bond turned into long-lasting friendship. “Saemah is like a sister to me. When we interacted for the first time, we argued over a mutual friend’s post. But later, we clicked and became best of friends. We met for the first time at Bandra station for five minutes, and bonded well. We have been by each other’s side through thick and thin. Her family loves me and vice versa,” says Anuradha, who feels that trust, time and patience are the key ingredients for finding the right bond on social media.\n",

      "Experts say it’s important to trust your gut when you are bonding with a person on social media. If you like talking to him or her, be frank about who you are. You can’t start a friendship or bond based on pretenses. Saemah says that their mutual understanding and willingness to hear each other out worked when they connected on a social networking site. Explaining how they trusted each other, Saemah adds, “When we realised that we don’t judge each other for what we say or opine, the trust strengthened. I feel every bond, whether it’s with someone you meet regularly or a social media contact, takes time. So, we started meeting occasionally, mostly on birthdays, and our friendship bloomed with every meeting. I loved her honesty and our wavelength matched.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Is it love?\n",
      "While some find true friends on social media, some find true love and subsequent life partners, too. Pooja Advani, a PR professional from Mumbai, connected with Omkar Pawaskar on social media in 2015. They fell in love and eventually, got married.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“We met after chatting for a month on the site. The first meeting was awkward for both of us, but we got along in subsequent meetings. We realised that our choices in terms of food and music, and expectations from life, were similar. We were always transparent in the relationship when we chatted on social media, and that reflected when we met, too,” says Pooja.\n",

      "Another Mumbaikar, Tanya Chopra connected with Rahul Sharma on a dating app. She never knew that she would end up marrying the guy. “I connected with Rahul in 2014. I was speaking to another guy at the same time and had spoken to a couple of them before as well. After a point, the conversation gets boring with the repeated questions, like ‘How are you?’ and ‘What are your hobbies?’ It’s the same drill. But with Rahul, it was different. He didn’t start the conversation with the usual. He asked me what my political views were, what I am like as a person. His knowledge and intelligence intrigued me and made me want to know him more,” she says.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Don’t play around\n",
      "It’s important to stay patient and not play around with sentiments on social networking sites if you want to find a true relationship. “When you start a relationship online, you have doubts. I was skeptical when Rahul and I started talking, because some men I connected with offered to meet me in my building at midnight after a 5-minute conversation. There were some who asked for my personal number a few seconds after connecting on social media. But Rahul did none of this. He gave me the time to get comfortable talking to him and opening up to him. We developed a strong bond and trust, and now, we are married,” says Tanya.\n",

      "If your areas of interest are common and your wavelengths match, striking a bond isn’t difficult. City-based celebrity manager Mona Jaswani found one of her closest friends four years ago on a photo-sharing social network. They bonded over their common spiritual beliefs. “We connected over spirituality, something which is quite unconventional when it comes to the younger generation. After knowing each other for a while, we realised that both of us were looking for a companion to connect with on the spiritual front. We didn’t exchange numbers and continued to chat on the site for months. The first time he invited me to meet was at a satsang (prayer meeting). I was surprised. We started going on walks and the topics we discussed included Lord Shiva, work and fitness,” she says.\n",

      "Happily flaunting her silver junk jewellery which she bought from Jaipur from one of her earlier visits, singer Shibani Kashyap says that Jaipur is one of her favourite cities. She was recently here again for work when she got talking to us about indulging in some retail therapy in Jaipur, her singing debut, and that she chooses her projects carefully to over-exposure of her voice. Shibani says, “I have mostly come here for shows. Once, I stayed back (after the show) for a day to explore Jaipur and went to Nahargarh Fort, Amber Fort, Jal Mahal and explored the historical side of the city. Jaipur is a fascinating city steeped in history and culture. Every time I come here, it takes me to an epoch of royalty and tradition. I also love the rich and diverse accommodation that the city offers, from havelis to luxurious palaces.”\n",
      "Shibani Kashyap in Jaipur (Shalini Maheshwari/BCCL)\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s often said that a trip to Jaipur is incomplete without visiting the old bazaars in the walled city. However, Shibani couldn’t visit the markets this time. But she did manage to indulge in some retail therapy at the Jaipur International Airport. Shibani says that she bought Jaipuri quilts and a few dresses in bandhej from one of the shops at the airport.\n",
      "Shibani Kashyap flaunts her silver jewellery, which she bought on one of her previous trips to the city\n",

      "\n",
      "On the professional front, Shibani is busy with her live shows apart from working on a video release of her song Don’t Drink And Drive. “The audio was released earlier.Now,we are working on its video,” she says. The song addresses the issue of drunken driving. Opening up on her love for independent music, the singer tells us, “I have come from independent music. My debut pop album Ho Gayi Hai Mohabbat is still fresh in people’s memories. It is something that I connect with. Independent music gives me more liberty and freedom to express myself, which I don’t think is the case with Bollywood music. It’s not in your control.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "While Shibani has to her credit a lot of songs, Bollywood and indie music, people still remember her for her song Sajna Aa Bhi Ja. Shibani says, “That’s true. I feel proud when I hear people singing my song and coming out with their own versions of it. It’s not easy to create a song like Sajna... I have travelled the world because of it. Even after so many years, if I am still identified with Sajna, I take it as a compliment. Having said that, I also want to urge my fans to listen to my other songs as well!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "With new singers coming up, fewer opportunities are left for senior artistes, something which singer Shaan had also spoken about earlier. Shibani opines, “I feel, the voices of singers like Shaan or Sonu Nigam are over exposed. And when that happens, the audience gets tired of hearing your voice, which paves the way for new voices. So, I have been careful in choosing my songs.\"\n",

      "Aasif Sheikh: Jo kabhi zindagi mein nahi mila hai, woh ab mil raha hai. How can I slow down now?\n",
      "TNN\n",
      "Hindi\n",
      "At 55, Aasif Sheikh is in an enviable position. While many of his peers have either been relegated to doing insignificant roles, or faded into oblivion, the actor has managed to stay relevant. Defying the norm of younger faces playing heroes on TV, Aasif is the lead on the show, 'Bhabiji Ghar Par Hai!'\n",
      "He says, “The show has given me a new lease of life. Usually, an actor my age makes peace with the fact that he would be reduced to playing just papa and chacha on screen. I was also losing hope and had in a way prepared myself to wear the usual kurta pajama and stand behind an array of actors. However, I would still pray to God for that one opportunity where I had the scope to perform. A meaty role like Vibhuti’s (his character in 'Bhabiji...') is unthinkable. My life revolves around this show. I reach home after the shoot, spend an hour with my family over dinner, hit the bed and go back to work the next day. But they all understand that it is worth the effort.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He adds, “My kids tell me to take it easy and slow down because I am 55 and yet running around. I tell them that I can’t. Jo kabhi zindagi mein nahi mila hai, woh ab mil raha hai. How can I slow down now? I have earned name, fame and money through this show. I will act till the time I can remember my lines.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Besides Vibhuti, Aasif has played over 250 characters and around 20 variations of a woman on the show. It’s the variety in the role that keeps him on his toes. He says, “Among other female characters, I have played Amrapali and a Chinese woman. After 1,200 episodes, there isn’t much left in the story to explore, so, we explore the characters. It’s always funny to see a man transform into a woman and I look good as a woman (laughs!). I have all shapes and sizes of clothes required to become a woman stored in my make-up room. In fact, my wife inquired about the eight pairs of sandals in my room when she visited the set once and I told her that they belonged to me. She was scandalised. I can play the quintessential heroine for a few episodes on a daily soap (laughs!). It takes me around four hours to dress like a woman, as I am very particular about my look. I sit with the team to finalise the look of the character I am playing.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The actor featured as a hero in films like 'Rama O Rama' (1988) and 'Yaara Dildara' (1991) and then hit a low. But he has no regrets over the slow phase in his career. He shares, “I like to move on and not regret anything in life. I started as a hero and did a few films, but there was no work for a few years. I played negative characters and bagged a role in 'Karan Arjun' (1995), which changed my life for the better. Life is a journey and I like to enjoy it. Earlier, I was seen as a decent performer, but this show has put me on a pedestal. It’s an overwhelming feeling. I am proud of what I am doing at this age. Ab return mil raha hai saalon ke hard work ka.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "While several youngsters prefer to take up finite shows after a long stint on a daily soap, Aasif says, “The idea to leave Bhabiji... has never crossed my mind. Finite or infinite, actors need to understand that they are playing characters on TV. It’s up to them to keep themselves amused and immersed in the character. I have been doing that since four years.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The show hit a roadblock when Shilpa Shinde, the original Angoori bhabhi, decided to quit the show three years ago. Aasif says, “I was the one who recommended Shilpa for that role. I had worked with her for a month on 'Chidiyaghar' and believed that she fit the bill. It was indeed a difficult time when she quit the show. But let me tell you, no one is indispensable on TV. The show will go on, maybe, the number of eyeballs will decrease. Things became alright after Shubhangi Atre joined as the new Angoori bhabhi. I feel the content makes a show and not just one character. Logon ke saath saath Shilpa ki bhi galat fehmi thi ki ek character show ko chalaata hai. She even told me, ‘I am the one who runs the show. Mere jaane ke baad show dekhna band ho jayega’. I told her that it was her biggest mistake to think like that. I am assuming she was being misguided by people. Of course, she was the most popular character on the show and her exit hit us. It took us around four months to recover.”\n",

    "Description=['Eighteen years have been kind to her; those who saw Isha Koppikar that many years ago in En Swasa Kaatre, opposite Arvind Swami, will recognise her in a jiffy even now. Tell her that, and she sasses back, “Nothing has changed here either. Same people, same city, same attitude… everything’s the same even now.” And this sets the tone for a then-and-now chat with her. Prompt with her answers, candid, with a healthy dose of self-praise thrown in, Isha tells why she stopped acting in Tamil films, why she’s, for the lack of a better word, making a ‘comeback’ with Sivakarthikeyan’s movie with Ravi Kumar as a femme fatale, and what she’s been up to in all these years…\\nA film with Sivakarthikeyan, no less!\\nThis project has been on for almost a year now. Last August, we had one schedule, then the January one this year got delayed and fell into February. We have one in September now.\\n\\nSo, a comeback?\\nI guess, yeah, you can call it that. Two years ago, I stepped into the south industry again with the Telugu movie Keshava, then did Looti in Kannada, I have another one lined up with Shivaraj sir… word got around and Ravi Kumar got in touch with me for this one, saying he has a role he wanted me to play. I played a cop in all of the movies mentioned above, but this one was full-on action, kind of Lara Croft-ish, and that got me interested.\\nA lot has changed in 18 years, has it?\\nNothing has changed — I don’t know whether this is good or bad. But there still are no heroine-centric roles down south, no experimentation, the same kind of stories. New-age cinema seems to have flown right over Tamil cinema. In Bollywood, we now have films that are with the times, like Gully Boy, there are small-budget films that have done exceedingly well — that Vicky Donor wave that brought in Shubh Mangal Saavdhan, Bareilly Ki Barfi, Badhaai Ho… almost all of Ayushmann Khurrana’s films should have made people down south think about upgrading the art of movie making, but no… we’re in love with stereotypes.\\n\\nThe stars?\\nOh, they too! They too! Arvind Swami is still around, Vijay is still at the top… when I focused back on south, I realised all my co-stars of 18 years ago are the one still rocking.\\n\\nThe going was good for you back then. Why did you leave?\\nI was studying. All of 15, just out of school, and I come from a family of doctors and educated people. So my dad said nothing doing. You must complete your graduation, or you are not stepping out of the house for anything. He said just in case your acting career doesn’t work out, you must have something to fall back upon. Well, that’s the system we live in, so I could hardly argue. So, I went on to complete BSc in Life Sciences. But between that, coming down south to do movies wasn’t possible. I kept modelling and doing music videos in Bombay, as I could juggle that because it was right there. The boarding, lodging, the distance meant I couldn’t juggle the schedules of Tamil films with that same ease. And when I turned 21, was done with studies and all, it was too late, I was well-settled in Mumbai.\\n\\nNow, you are a mom. And the industry, especially down south, isn’t known to be fascinated with that ilk…\\nYeah, I feel that; all the time. But not explicitly, not yet. I mean no one has said that to my face. Of course, Ramya Krishnan has done a great job with her career – she’s continued right through marriage and all. But when people here look at me, the first reaction is, ‘How have you maintained yourself so well?’ They’re surprised that I am still in shape despite marriage and childbirth. I tell them if you want to be in show business, you better look good!\\n\\nThey tell you you’re hot?\\nThat’s the common refrain. ‘My God, you still look awesome.’ It makes me feel great. All the carbs I have not eaten all these years is at last making me feel it was all worth it. But I am amazed how I have been welcomed here — with grace and aplomb.\\n\\nSo, what are you doing in this Sivakarthikeyan movie?\\nIt’s something not seen before here. We have not had the concept of a well-etched out ‘alien’ in Tamil cinema before this. Even in Bollywood, there was Jaadu in Koi... Mil Gaya, that’s it. And even that was more of prosthetics. But this film is all about CG. It’s almost as if two films are being made — one on computer and CG, and one that we are physically shooting.\\n\\nAny old friends? Favourite stars?\\nI meet old, and new ones, too. Favourite stars… Arvind Swami is my all-time favourite because I have worked with him. And I used to be quite fond of Ajith back then — I don’t know if he’s still around, though…\\n\\nAnd Sivakarthikeyan, your current co-star?\\nHe reminds me so much of a younger version of Rajini sir that sometimes I am taken aback.\\n\\nWhy? Does he emulate Rajinikanth?\\nNo, it’s not because of his mannerisms, or anything. I am not saying he’s consciously trying to emulate Rajini sir, but it’s there. Maybe the hair, the face, the look in the eye, the colour… Something.\\n\\nThere are so many Bollywood heroines trying to make a mark down south now. Will you find your niche?\\nBut there is no action heroine down south, yet. And I fit the bill — I play the femme fatale in this one, and I look like that. Even if I say so myself, I know that I am versatile. People look at my role in Shabri and say, oh, de-glam. But truth is I was made to look de-glam with heavy makeup because I know that I look good without any makeup, too. I used to spend hours scrubbing off all that during Shabri. I also love these kind of dancing and action roles, too. I am a black belt in Taekwondo, and I still practise twice a week, fitness is a passion with me, and that helps.\\n\\nAnd the language?\\nI am good with languages. I can grasp easily, plus, I used to chant Sanskrit mantras when I was young, and that helps with the pronunciation. I encourage all of them on the set to speak to me in Tamil.\\n\\nSo, when you have to emote in a strange language, or that chemistry with a co-star you’ve never heard of before, how does that happen?\\nThe emoting isn’t tough — happiness and sadness have no language. About the co-star, yea, I still don’t know anything about Sivakarthikeyan personally. But thankfully, there’s no love between us in the movie. I am the killing machine and all full of hatred! I look glam, and hot and am the femme fatale. So thankfully, no love and chemistry.\\n\\nHave you travelled much down south?\\nI’ve been to Tirupati, and the other day, on the way to the shooting spot, on OMR, I saw all these shoe stores so we zipped in there. I love food from Saravana Bhavan, and Krishna Sweets – I take their mysorepak for the whole city when I go back. (laughs)\\n\\n\\nWhat else — what have you been up to all these years?\\nI’m a full-time mother, now, have a hospitality business, production house, and am also into politics now, having joined the BJP.\\n\\n\\nWhy politics?\\nI believe we need a strong leader, strict rules and laws. We Indians work only under pressure. If we are told ‘if you don’t do this, you’ll be penalised’, we will do it. We need to be forced into compliance, and hence need strict ruling. Look at all our scriptures, for instance. Most of what’s in them are scientific, but how did they make us follow them? By putting the fear of God in us — ‘If you don’t do this, something bad will happen’…\\n\\n\\nBut there are so many stars out there as politicians…\\nI don’t care. I believe that because we are celebs, people tend to accept what we do or say sooner than they would an\\n\\naam aadmi. That’s why we endorse products. So why not endorse thoughts and ideologies? Why not help the helpless?',\n",
    " 'If you think children’s stories are mostly about chocolate factories and Cinderella, a new play is here to prove you wrong. City-based group Theatre Dots is opening a sequel to its well-received drama, Act or Not to Act, in the city this weekend. The new piece, titled Say No to Plays, is filled with scenes of laughter and a few awkward and serious moments. It scrutinises 15 reasons to make one think twice before auditioning for a play.\\n\\n“Primarily divided in two parts, the play features as many as 30 young artistes, who are constantly in pressure to meet the expectations of their parents while pursuing their dream in performing arts. Obsession and addiction are among the themes that are explored in the course of the play. Six monologues comprise the first half of the performance, while the second half dabbles in questions like what is more important — the depth or prominence of an actor in a scene, or how much he/she has actually enjoyed enacting it,” explains Pooja Singh, writer and director of the play.\\n\\n\\nLoosely based on an American play series, Say No to Plays “offers a glimpse into teenagers’ private thoughts”. The story aims at making one introspect about the amount of pressure that is mounted on kids. The 80-minute show also includes an original track, the lyrics of which are written by Pooja, and music is composed by two students. It is being staged at Rangasthala auditorium, Rangoli Metro Art Center on March 3.',\n",
    " 'When Yajamana, produced by Media House Studio, hits theatres today, fans of Challenging Star Darshan will have reason to rejoice, as it brings him back to the big screen after a year-and-a-half. The film, directed by V Harikrishna and P Kumar, pairs Darshan with Rashmika Mandanna and has actors like Tanya Hope, Devaraj, Dhananjaya, P Ravi Shankar and Thakur Anoop Singh, as part of its ensemble cast. Here, Darshan tells us what makes his film a must-watch.\\n\\n“For starters, I want to clarify that we have not set out to do anything extraordinary. Yajamana is a clean entertainer with the right amounts of action, comedy, romance and drama that will appeal to family audiences. Apart from the fact that it is my film, Yajamana has a strong story and message for society. Cinematographer Sreesha Kuduvalli’s visuals are a highlight and the two tones he has used in different parts of the film are noteworthy. The songs by Harikrishna are an added bonus. Most importantly, you will see a variation in my dialogue delivery,” says Darshan.',\n",
    " \"So you think the paper towel you have at home is just for wiping and cleaning? Heck, no! There are so many things you can do with them apart from the regular. Here are four genius hacks that will leave you impressed.\\nSmelly shoe deodorizer\\n\\nSpread the paper towel on the table and add 3-4 tablespoons of baking soda. Now roll the paper and seal using a rubberband. The next time your shoes smell, prepare such potlis and slide it inside your shoes to free them of the smell.\\n\\n\\nEmpower your wiper\\nDo you have wooden flooring at home and can't use wet mops? Well, there is an easy hack for that - for which you can use paper towels. Slide and tear a big paper towel and attach it to the bottom of your regular wiper - lock it well to the corner too so it doesn't move. Now spray slight water on it or any disinfectant. Mop the floor and you will see how it magically attracts all the mess, keeping your wooden floor clean and clear.\\n\\n\\nUse the roll to save plastic bags\\n\\nWhat do you do when the paper towel roll gets empty - throw it? Well, do not. The plastic bags that you keep stocking here and there can all be stored inside these rolls without creating any clutter.\\n\\n\\nTurn it into a cord organiser\\n\\nAnother brilliant use of the empty roll is to use them as cord organiser. Cut them into two and slide your wires/cord inside to keep them safe and detangled.\\n\\n\\nAren't paper towels more versatile than you think? Dust, declutter and deodorize!\",\n",
    " 'On Wednesday afternoon, singer Chinmayi Sripada tweeted to Union Minister for Women and Child Development Maneka Gandhi and National Commission for Women (NCW), highlighting that no action has been taken after she named Vairamuthu as her predator in the #MeToo movement. She wrote, “Maam, it’s been 4 months since I named Mr Vairamuthu as my predator. I have since then been banned from work in the TN Film Industry (Dubbing Union). The law as of today doesn’t allow me to file a case. Please give me a solution. @PMOIndia (Sic).” Soon after, Maneka Gandhi replied to her, “I have taken up your case with@NCWIndia. Kindly DM your contact details.” Talking to us, the singer says, “I’m grateful that she responded this time. I’m waiting to see if this will lead to something. The NCW has been given complaints before. They just need to take cognizance of complaints and set up an enquiry commission. They could have easily set up a fact-finding committee and called us and the offenders for an enquiry. We don’t know whose door to knock on. So many playback singers have anonymously taken names of their offenders, but since there’s no action, they are not willing to speak up. Solli enna aaga poradhu? Unakku edhavadhu aacha? (What will happen with sharing our story? Did anything happen from your case?) — that’s what they ask. I hope there is a positive outcome now at least.”\\n\\nSruthi hopeful with this move\\n\\nMeanwhile, Kannada actress Sruthi Hariharan, who had come forth with her #MeToo ordeal against actor-filmmaker Arjun Sarja sees this as a significant step. “Chinmayi has been relentless in her pursuit for the #MeTooIndia movement. She has not only stood her ground and fought her case, but has helped many others share their case. I am glad that she tagged Maneka Gandhi and the Prime Minister’s office in her tweet, because she finally got a reply.

    " 'Does it take away anything from a director’s accolades if he acknowledges a source? Does the stature of a director dip if he shares the writing credits? Does it cost a lot to pay a few lakhs to procure rights of Bengali novels/short stories?The answer is a big No.\\nThat’s something Anurag Kashyap understood when he directed Dev.D. He went to town to acknowledge that he was making a modern-day adapatation of Saratchandra Chattopadhyay novel. No one would have dragged him to court had he not mentioned that. Yet, Anurag spoke about his Saratchandra connection. In our own backyard, Buddhadab Dasgupta directed Dooratwa from Sirshendu Mukherjee’s work. His Tahader Katha was based on Kamal Kumar Majumdar’s story by the same name. While his Uttara was adapted from Samaresh Basu’s work, Charachar was an adaptation of a Prafulla Roy work. More recently, when Aparna Sen directed Arshinagar with Dev as Ranajit Mitra and Rittika Sen as Julekha Khan, she mentioned it was a musical adaptation of William Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet.\\n\\nUnfortunately, there are many who find it too difficult to credit a source. That’s why plagiarism charges have been levelled by fans and family members of authors like Moti Nandi, Atin Bandopadhyay and Suchitra Bhattacharya, among others. In some cases, the similarities are coincidental. In others, there is a lot more than that.\\nThe problem is the culture of silence. Most authors don’t protest for fear of problems. But, they crib in privacy while expecting the world around to fight for their rights. Directors, meanwhile, happily ruin the chances of official adaptation rights being sold to those willing to credit.\\nLEGENDS ARE USUALLY SPARED\\nWorks of Rabindranath Tagore, Satyajit Ray, Saratchandra Chattopadhyay, Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay, Saradindu Bandopadhyay, Bibhutibushan Bandopadhyay or Tarashankar Bandopadhyay have largely been credited. When Manas read the three-page Bibhutibushan story titled Taal Nabami, he added some characters and finally, made the 90-minute-long Sahaj Paather Gappo. “It is all about an individual’s ethics. To each his own. For me, giving credit — however little I take from a novel or story — is my duty and responsibility,” says Manas.\\n\\nIS IT AN EGO ISSUE?\\n\\nPerhaps, ego plays an important role. “Even Sunil Gangopadhyay was not spared. An internationally-reputed director had lifted some portions from his Shei Samay while making a movie. Not just films, Bengali serials too have cases where the original writers weren’t credited. A few years back, Atin Bandopadhyay’s Neel Kantha Pakhir Khonje was telecast as a popular serial without acknowledging him. Such controversies were unheard of with directors like Ray, Ghatak or Mrinal Sen. Today’s Tollywood directors try to place themselves in a position which does not rightfully belong to them. They also ignore the financial aspect,” says author Prabal Kumar Basu.\\n\\n\\nTOLLYWOOD’S FIRST-BOY SYNDROME\\n\\nSome directors also end up measuring the extent of the inspiration. But that’s not the point, insists Buddhadeb. “I adapted Mondo Meyer Upakhyan from Prafulla Roy’s short story by the same name. I made Grihajuddha from Dibyendu Palit’s Maach. I made Tope from Narayan Gangopdhyay’s work. In all these cases, I changed a lot from the original works. Trust me, it takes away nothing from a director’s skill if the writing credit goes to someone else. Nobody thought of me as any less of a director for adapting Maach,” says Buddhadeb. This “first-boy syndrome”, he says, is doing harm to the industry. “It’s not that great movies are being made when sources remain undisclosed,” adds Buddhadeb.\\n\\n\\nDOES EVERYONE WANT TO BE A NEW-AGE RAY?\\n\\nJust as a bohemian attitude can’t turn a director into Ritwik Ghatak, being a writer-director too can’t thrust the genius of Ray on makers. Many don’t realise that Bengal still has a fair share of bookworms who can easily identify sources. Some years ago, authors like Sirshendu Mukherjee and Debesh Roy had written to Bangladesh’s information ministry to protest when plagiarism charges were levelled on the makers of Brihannala in Bangladesh for copying Syed Mustafa Siraj’s Gachta Bolecilo. Subsequently, the Bangladesh government cancelled three national film awards bestowed upon Brihannala. Abhijit Siraj, the author’s son, says, “This wouldn’t have happened without a protest. Silence is a crime. Such plagiarism will continue if an author doesn’t have a spine to stand up for his rights.”\\n\\n\\nWell, is everyone listening?',\n",

She adds, “And that was a short line. There were longer lines I had to say, but actress Rohini maam, who was also part of the film, helped me out immensely.

    " 'He’s playing Uttam Kumar in Soumik Sen’s debut Bengali film, Mahalaya. In a chat with us, Jisshu U Sengupta talks about his experience of playing the legend, childhood memories of Mahalaya, working with the new director and the film. Excerpts:\\nWhat was your first reaction when Soumik approached you to play Uttam Kumar?\\n\\nWhen I heard the script, I was blown away, as I was not aware of the 1976 incident when Uttam Kumar had replaced Birendra Krishna Bhadra’s voice in Mahishasura Mardini. Initially, I was jittery at the thought of playing the legend. But I later realised the film is much more than that.\\n\\n\\nHow challenging was it to step into the shoes of the legend?\\nI’ve played the character in my own way and I request everyone to not compare me with the stalwart. My mother-in-law told me how Uttam Kumar was as a person. She said Uttam babu was witty, big-hearted, a foodie and always eager to help the technicians. These details helped me portray him better. Not for once did I try to copy him.\\n\\nTell us about the film.\\n\\nThe film explores the psyche behind the government’s decision to replace Birendra Krishna Bhadra and tries to answer some popular queries — did Uttam Kumar do it willingly and what was Birendra Krishna Bhadra’s reaction? Did they actually have a fight over this?\\n\\n\\nHow was it working with Soumik?\\n\\nHe is a very sorted director, completely chilled out on the sets. He knows exactly what he wants from his team. It needs courage to make a film like this, so kudos to Bumbada (Prosenjit Chatterjee) for taking the initiative. Not for once did he interfere with the script or anything related to the film. I don’t know how much money the film will make at the box office but it will surely go down in the history of Bengali cinema for its subject. Subhasish Mukhopadhyay’s performance as Birendra Krishna Bhadra is just brilliant.\\n\\n\\nDo you listen to Mahishasura Mardini on Mahalaya?\\n\\nOh yes! During my childhood, Ma would wake me up early morning and I’d invariably fall asleep after listening to it for half an hour or so. Mahalaya meant no studies, so that used to be fun.',\n",
    " 'A day after social media turned into a warzone what with allegations of plagiarism levelled against Kaushik Ganguly’s Nagarkirtan, it has gone all quiet on the virtual front. Author Swapnamoy Chakraborty, who also spoke to CT after many pointed out the similarities between the novel, Holde Golap and the film, made a U-turn after watching it on Wednesday. “It’s not a cinematic adaptation of my film,” he said.\\n\\n\\nSaid the author, “I was wary as I had heard about Abul Bashar’s incident, where he felt that his Naram Hridoyer Chinho was plagiarised in Shunyo E Buke. Also, many said Khaad bore resemblances with a film. That’s why I had given the post.” Chakraborty attributed the similarities with a few common sources. “I spoke to several people and also did field survey while penning the story; chances are, Kaushik Ganguly spoke to the same people. If Kaushik today says he hasn’t read my book, I won’t be able to say he’s lying,” said the author.\\n\\n\\nChakraborty, who says the credits appeared on the screen for a fleeting two seconds, said it could have lingered on for a bit more time. “While writing my novel, I spoke to Manabi Bandopadhyay, among others. She gave me valuable inputs. Looks like, she has provided a lot of matter to Kaushik too. But at the end of it, it’s a love story that mine is not. Having said that, I will never disrespect the views of those who pointed out the similarities.” Said Kaushik, “What he had said was out of his concerns about his novel. Though it’s sad that he couldn’t keep faith in me, I am grateful that he finally watched the film and revised his statement. But I’m far more worried about those who aren’t Swapnamoy Chakraborty and made one post after another on social media. During mob violence, the target is sometimes tied to the lamppost and even passers-by, without knowing what is happening, pelt stones at him. Social media has become a violent place. The ones writing against me are those for whom I make films. And every story of mine can be similar to another story happening in some part of the world. I write stories out of my own experiences and another person may be going through the same at some point in time. All I want to say is, think before you act.

    " \"The response that she got since the release of her film 'Pink' two years ago has helped Taapsee Pannu find her footing in the industry. The actress, who is now looking forward to the release of her next, Sujoy Ghosh’s thriller 'Badla', with Amitabh Bachchan, says, “A lot of things happened between 'Pink' and 'Badla' that validated my choices and made me a more confident actor. When 'Pink' happened, I did not know which way my career was going to go. I was trying and testing different films to see where my calling was and when 'Pink' released, it gave me a direction. After that, I was sure of one thing – that I would always take up roles which are part of the main storyline. I mean, if you take out this character from the film, the story will not be the same. The other thing is that I want to play a woman with a spine, because I can connect personally to it and that helps me perform better. The audience response to my work has sort of validated my choice of films.” Taapsee, who was in her hometown Delhi recently, adds that like her previous roles, in 'Badla', she is again playing a strong woman who stands her ground and is confident. She adds, “The character I am playing is pretty confident from the beginning itself. You will not see her vulnerable side, and you won’t see her as someone who would think she is helpless. She knows very well what she wants, she is borderline arrogant because she has made everything for herself from scratch in a foreign land. She has this thing in her mind that no matter what, I will manoeuvre my way out of any situation. She has appointed this lawyer, played by Mr Bachchan in the film. She has hired this man to fight her case, and she has that control over the person she has employed. Like Sujoy’s female characters in his other films like 'Kahaani', this one too is extremely powerful.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThough Taapsee agrees that there are few examples of good, edge-of-the-seat thrillers in Bollywood, she feels that 'Badla' won’t disappoint. “One can’t think of many good thrillers in Bollywood. 'Kahaani' was a good thriller, so was 'Gupt'. Thriller is one of the oldest genres of cinema, but these days, people are not touching it much. The reason could be that it is a very tricky genre, at any point, if your audience can predict the end, your film has fallen flat. You have to keep the audience so engrossed that they are not able to predict the end. Even if you leave theatre for 30 seconds while watching 'Badla', you won’t understand what has happened, you won’t be able to connect the dots,” says Taapsee, who will be sharing screen space with Bachchan again in 'Badla' after 'Pink'. “My confidence level was surely different this time when I worked with him. After 'Pink', I share a certain comfort level in working with him, but even in 'Pink' working with him was never intimidating for me. I am not a very star-struck person, may be because of the fact that I didn’t grow up obsessing over films. I had seen Mr Bachchan’s films while having lunch or dinner with family, but it’s not like I have grown in awe of all the actors. I only get intimidated when I am with a bunch of extremely talented actors, where I know I am not a trained actor, which happened in 'Mulk' with me. But I enjoy working with Mr Bachchan. People think I must be blanking out when I look into his eyes and perform, but I actually get excited,” she says.\\n\\n\\nFACEBOOKTWITTERPINTREST\",\n",

There was almost a sea of gowns in the hue — in poufy frills, netted ruffles, princess-style trail gowns, bubble-gum hued tulles and more.

So, go with skater, shift dresses and other styles in it, for the upcoming season.\\n- Yes, this is a pretty shade, but you don’t want to look too girly in it, so break the monotony of the hue with black, navy blue and grey.\\n- Since pink is also a light shade, it is perfect for those ruffles, frills and poufs.\\n- Keep away the stiff, black heels and make pink your new neutral footwear. Opt for pumps, peep toes, kitten heels and stilettos in bright or baby pink.\\n\\n- Planning to wear all-black? Pink comes in as the perfect complement. Wear pink stud earrings or hoops as well a pop pink clutch or quilted bag to go with the rest of the look.\\n\\n- Love athleisure? Weave pink into your gym wear with pink keds, tracks with a neon pink stripe or even a fuchsia top over those black leggings.\\n\\n- Team a pink halter with white jeans for a day outdoors.\\n\\n- Grab a pair of sunnies with a pink frame to complete the look.

Apart from certain specific training programmes, the individual is often excluded from other help. While education remains a life-long process for everyone else, a large number of autistic individuals are deprived of it at an early age,” says artist and art consultant Sneha Joshi, who is curating Eye Contact: An insight into autism — a special event in Bengaluru.\\n\\nWhile the primary goal of the initiative is to raise awareness about the developmental disorder, help erase the stigma around it and make art more accessible to autistic individuals, the event —which comprises an exhibition, a performance and a panel discussion — also aims at forming a more inclusive society that embraces marginalised communities and help them thrive. “We want to take conversations about autism to public places and open forums, where people can participate and discuss issues and possible solutions. This would not only enable young adults suffering from this disorder express themselves, but also create a comfort zone for them to identify their inherent talents and showcase them,” explains Sneha, who has an autistic brother. Family narratives as well as personal experiences of caretakers are other focus areas of the initiative. According to Sneha, art and media can be instrumental in making society more inclusive. The event will be conducted by Colours Centre for Learning, in association with The Be A Smile Project — a research project investigating autism and society.

    " 'Many ‘new’ comedians have made a mark for themselves in Kollywood of late and are doing back-to-back films. But Vivekh’s comedy, which often touches upon social causes, still remains the favourite of many Kollywood film buffs. The veteran actor, who still gives young comedians a run for their money, thanks to his spontaneity and thought-provoking one-liners, is gung-ho about his upcoming projects, among which he considers Vellai Pookal to be unique. In a freewheeling chat withus, he talks about topics that include movies, nature conservation, sexual crimes, caste system, and more...\\nLooks like Vellai Pookal isn’t ‘your kind of film’. You are playing a serious cop and have sported salt ‘n’ pepper looks, too…\\nIt all started when the film’s director Vivek Elangovan, a US-based Microsoft engineer, approached me with a story. But I was skeptical about the project even materialising when the makers said they wanted me to go to the US. They needed my dates for a month and asked me to go to Seattle. Later, they sent me the summary of the film, but I said I need the entire script, which has details of every scene irrespective of the number of scenes I’m a part of. After going through it, I felt this is a script which someone who has Sathyaraj sir’s physique and screen presence would do justice to. But they convinced me by saying that audience will be prepared to watch certain scenes with actors who have not done such roles before. I play a retired DIG (Intelligence) who goes to the US to meet his son, with whom he has had a difference of opinion. Audience expect comedy from me, so I had reservations initially. But then, I felt this is the right time to try something different. Our viewers are yearning for novelty these days and they appreciate honest and innovative attempts.\\n\\nHow has the industry reacted to your makeover?\\nMany of them loved it. AR Rahman has always been a good friend of mine. I showed him the teaser and he was impressed by it. I asked him if he could do music and he said he has his hands full. We told him that we can wait till he gets sometime from his hectic schedule. Though we waited for a year, he couldn’t do it because of his busy assignments.\\nThere is an influx of thrillers in Kollywood now. How is this film going to be different?\\nThe good thing is all these films were received well, which is an advantage for our project, too. Our film has lot of mind games and edge-of-the-seat moments with ample emotions. Though most artistes in it are from the US, Charlie, Pooja Devariya and newbie Dev have interesting roles in it.\\n\\nWhat are your other projects?\\nThese days, many seem to be embracing agriculture. I have been thinking about a movie on farming and related stuff and am currently writing a script — it needs a commercially viable hero. I will be directing the movie, too, which will have humour as its main attraction, though the content discussed in it will be quite serious and relevant.\\n\\nYou are teaming up with Vijay after a long time in Atlee’s upcoming film.\\nWe are teaming up after more than a decade. Kuruvi was the last film we did together. He had called me up recently and said that he’s happy to join hands with me again. Vijay told me “we should rock” and Atlee is keen on portraying me in a jovial role. I’m excited to join the team soon.\\n\\nThere was news on you teaming up with Sivakarthikeyan\\nThat was actually news for me as well. Siva had once said that I’m his inspiration for doing comedy. I would love to do a movie with him.\\n\\nYou had a small role in Viswasam which went on to become one of the top grossing films in the state\\nI’m so happy the movie did well. Siva approached me and said that my role comes only in the second half. He said there are scenes where I have to make fun of Ajith’s character and that I would be the best person for the same. We had some beautifully shot scenes, but couldn’t retain it. There is a scene where I utter his popular dialogue “en vazhkaila ovvoru naalum ovvoru nimishamum yen ovvoru nodiyaiyum naana sedhukkunadhu da” to him, to which he gives a funny counter. Fans would have loved that scene has it been retained. It was a pleasure to work again with Nayanthara after a decade, as well.\\n\\nAre there any recent movies from which you enjoyed comedy thoroughly?\\nThere are many and it would be difficult to choose a few among them. The style of comedy in cinema has now changed. The average duration of a movie was more than 2.30 hours when Vadivelu and I used to have separate comedy tracks. Now people are impatient and can’t sit through a movie which is more than two hours. Even when watching movies of lesser duration, they get sidetracked with mobile videos and messages on phone. So, we comedians do not get so much of time to create an impact. People who perform in Tik Tok and YouTube channels have more followers these days because they have the liberty to take as much as time they want to. It’s difficult to perform full-fledged comedy like how I did in films like Saamy, Kadhal Sadugudu, Uthamaputhiran, Maapillai, Padikkathavan, etc.\\n\\nIs there a movie after watching which you felt disappointed not being a part of it?\\nI was in talks with the veteran filmmaker KC Bokadia for a political film which had good dose of humour. That was around the time LKG and NOTA were announced, and went on floors. And so Bokadia’s film was scrapped. But after watching LKG, I felt we should have gone ahead with our movie as well. Our project would also have been liked by audience.\\n\\n\\nLooks like we are heading towards a scorching summer this year. As a nature enthusiast, do you think we are taking our natural resources for granted?\\nI have now completed planting 30.23 lakh saplings and have 70 lakh more to complete the mission given by the beloved Abdul Kalam sir. I have always been vocal about preserving water and living a nature-friendly life. Many homes here haven’t received metro water for a long time. People are slowly realising that depending on AC while staying indoors will not work. In places like Pudukottai and other delta areas, you get bore water only after digging 2,000 ft deep. Of late, many people talk about the need to provide water to birds. The unfortunate fact is that human beings are also running short of water. At least five trees should be planted for every tree which is cut down.\\n\\n\\nTo what extent do you think the #MeToo movement has created an impact in the film industry here?\\nI think awareness has been created now. Our culture has always been about treating women as mothers. It is sad that women are treated as mere sex objects by many. Even small children are being sexually abused. Sexual perversion, frustration and depression are turning people into beasts. Only stringent punishment can control such incidents. When an accused gets bail easily and such cases take years to get a verdict, people aren’t really worried about the law. The easy access to pornography is another reason why, I think, there is an increase in the number of such crimes. We never had so many shocking crimes two or three decades ago. In such cases, 25 per cent is due to the influence of cinema and 75 per cent because of unlimited access to pornography.\\n\\n\\nAs a socially-conscious person what do you think are things which require urgent attention?\\nWe need self-sufficient farmers, massive planting of trees, innovative ways to conserve water and proper education. Education is the key to abolishing caste system. There was a time I felt such discrimination is coming to an end, but sadly, it has only come up all over again in the recent times. Even in today’s age of WhatsApp, Facebook, latest gadgets and communication facilities, people are discussing caste and using these apps to instigate communal riots.',\n",
    " 'They have been bringing to life the characters that keep you glued to the television sets. They have been making sure the same characters seem believable and that they have contributed in heaps towards the serials’ popularity. And yet, they work behind the camera, away from the glitz and glamour. CT features the directors behind popular serials to know about their work, ambition and what makes them click with the audiences. Read on...\\n\\n\\nRajendra Prasad Das\\nKnown for: Karunamoyee Rani Rashmoni\\n\\nOther significant works: I am working in the industry for the past 19-20 years and it’s been 8-9 years since I’ve stepped into a director’s shoes. I have directed serials like Milan Tithi, Mem Bou, Anchol, Tumi Robe Nirobe, Khona, Bindi to name a few. But Karunamoyee Rani Rashmoni is one serial that touched the pinnacle of popularity.\\n\\n\\nWhat makes his serial/serials stand out: Rani Rashmoni is a popular character but people did not know much about her. The serial is not a documentary on her neither it is a historical piece. I try to tell a story through the serial and I hope that I’ve been able to keep it interesting. I love to experiment with characters, moments and storyline and I guess that has worked for the better.\\n\\nBig screen aims: If I get the opportunity, I will surely want to direct a film. I believe in the adage, cross the bridge when you get there.\\n\\n‘I am working with Rajen uncle since two years and he is nothing less than a father to me. From guiding me to making me learn all the nitty-gritty of acting — he has taught me a lot. He sometimes shouts at us but I know it’s to make sure we give our best. What I like the most about him is his approach towards a scene. He gives a lot of space to his actors and always asks them to act logically. The credit for the serial’s popularity goes entirely to him. His constant suggestion to us is that we shouldn’t let success go to our heads’\\n— Ditipriya Roy (who plays the titular character)\\n\\nBabu Banik\\nKnown for: Jahaanara\\n\\nOther significant works: Jahaanara is my 19th serial. Previously I have worked on Niyoti, Bodhu Boron, Amar Durga, Jamai Raja to name a few. My first direction was for Raat Bhor Bhristi followed by Ei Ghor Ei Songsar, Heroes and Lukhochuri. Three to four of my serials have crossed more than 1,000 episodes. I believe that’s no mean feat!\\nWhat makes his serial/serials stand out: I deal with bold subjects like triple talaq in Jahaanara. There’s no show on Bengali television that has touched upon this topic. The serial revolves around a Muslim girl, Jahaanara, who speaks for the rights of women. The serial is about women emancipation — told through the story of a Muslim girl — and that I believe is its uniqueness.\\n\\n\\n\\nBig screen aims: I got a lot of offers to do remakes but I have maintained a strict no-no. I want to direct original films. I am currently working on two scripts. One is about a father-daughter relationship. Actor Arindam Ganguly and Kheyali Dastidar, who are my mentors, have arranged a meeting with Prosenjit Chatterjee because I wrote the script keeping Bumbada in mind. That apart, there is another script for which we are trying to get Nawazuddin Siddiqui on board. The story is about a guy who loses his wife due to gambling!\\n\\n‘Jahaanara is my debut serial. Babuda is a very senior director but not for once has he made me feel like a newcomer. He explains a scene so well that there is hardly any room for confusion. And during late-night shoots, when we are all low on energy, he will shout, ‘mood chai team, mood ano’ and we immediately get all charged up!’\\n— Sweta Mishra (who plays the titular character)\\n\\nBabu Banik\\nKnown for: Jahaanara\\n\\nOther significant works: I started my career as an assistant director in films like Bindaas, Majnu, Byomkesh Bakshi and Tor Naam. Later, I worked as an episode director for serials like Deep Jwele Jai and Soubhaggobati. I have debuted as a full-time director with Joyee.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat makes his serial/serials stand out: The story revolves around Joyee, who plays football and at the same time, looks after her household. She balances both the world and represents women in today’s time who strike a balance between thriving careers and happy homes. It encourages today’s youth to straddle both the worlds with ease. I try to lend a cinematic touch to the serial and I guess that makes it look different from the others.\\n\\nBig screen aims: My ambition is to direct a thriller. I would love to cast Ritwick Chakraborty and Rudranil Ghosh in my debut film; that is if they are convinced with the story.\\n\\n‘Arghyada’s dedication shows when he is behind the camera. He is like a guardian to\\nthe unit. He is a great team leader’\\n— Debadrita Basu\\n(who plays the titular character)\\n\\n\\nAmit Sengupta\\nKnown for: Debi Chaudhurani\\n\\nOther significant works: I have directed more than 18-20 serials so far, including Khona, Kajori, Gouridaan, Subho Bibaho, Sedin Dujone, Kajallata and Meera.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat makes his serial/serials stand out: The life story of Debi Chaudhurani itself is the serial’s USP. The peroid drama, led by a woman protagonist, is set in a time when most women did not even show her face to men outside her immediate family. The show brings alive the story of Prafulla, an ordinary girl and her inspiring journey to become Debi Chaudhurani, a leader and warrior loved and respected by everyone.\\n\\nBig screen aims: I’m working towards my goal of directing a film and I’m certain it will happen at the right time. There are a few stories in my mind.\\n\\n‘This is my debut serial and I feel honoured to work with Amitda. From dialogue delivery to how to face the light — I have learned a lot from him. I wouldn’t be able to deliver difficult scenes if it wasn’t for Amitda’\\n— Sona Moni Saha (who plays the titular character)\\n\\n\\nKamalesh Biswas\\nKnown for: Ke Apon Ke Por\\n\\nOther significant works: I have worked as episode director in more than 25 mega serials like Protidaan, Jibon Jyoti, Agnijol, Tomay Amay Mile, Kotha Dilam and Bamakhepa. Ke Apon Ke Por is my debut serial as a director.\\n\\nWhat makes his serial/serials stand out: Ke Apon Ke Por is a huge hit among the audience because of its storyline. The story revolves around Jaba, who starts out as a domestic help and goes on to establish herself as someone who’s well suited to be the daughter-in-law of the household and a lawyer by profession. The story stresses on the fact that everything is possible if one has the determination and perseverance.\\n\\nBig screen aims: I have worked as an assistant director in films like Glamour and Risk. But I’d love to direct a film someday. I’m already working on a story about a town where people are trying to bring in changes for the betterment of the public but are facing opposition from the government. I would love to cast Sohini Sarkar and Anirban Bhattacharya in this film.\\n\\n‘This is the first time that I’m working with Kamaleshda and I’m thankful to him for teaching me the nuances of acting. The best part about him is that he never loses his cool on the sets and guides each and every actor so they can perform\\nbetter. He does his homework well so there is a method to his direction’\\n— Pallabi Sharma (who plays Jaba in the serial)\\n\\n\\nSubho (Subhashis Mondal)\\n\\nPopular for: Mahaprabhu Sree Chaitanya\\n\\nOther significant works: I started my career as an assistant director and got a lot of appreciation for my work in serials like Agnipariksha and Rashi. Radha, for which I was an episode director, got me a lot of praise because the audiences thought the serial was nothing less than a film look-wise. Mahaprabhu Sree Chaitanya is the first serial that I am directing and I am grateful that the audience has shown so much love for it.\\n\\n\\nWhat makes his work stand out: In today’s world of violence and hatred, the serial Mahaprabhu Sree Chaitanya tries to establish the fact that love and compassion still exist. Not only do I work on subjects that are relatable but I also try to shoot in a way that the serial looks realistic.\\n\\n\\nBig-screen plans: My dream is to direct a film someday. I’m already working on a few scripts that delve into topics like homosexuality and prostitution. I’m also planning to direct a love story where I want to cast Gaurav Chakrabarty and Ridhima Ghosh. For my debut film, I’d love to cast Abir Chatterjee and Parambrata Chatterjee.',\n",
    " 'We had told you that Amala Paul will be playing a forensic pathologist in an upcoming film titled Cadaver. The film, directed by debutant Anoop Panicker, went on floors on Monday, and the actress says that she needed to do a lot of prep work to get ready to play this role. “We have seen this character in investigative films, but here, the entire script revolves around one. Playing a forensic pathologist requires maturity and knowledge about the subject,” begins the actress.\\n\\nHaving taken computer science group in school and not being interested in the field of medicine then, Amala says that she needs a lot of support to play this role. “The script is by Abhilash Pillai, and he has taken inspiration from the book Oru Police Surgeonate Ormakurippukal by Dr Umadathan, a famous forensic surgeon in Kerala. I got a lot of insights into the character by reading the book. I also met Dr Umadathan and spoke to him about his work,” she informs.\\n\\n\\nAmala, who will not have any romantic pair in the film, also travelled with a forensic surgeon for a couple of days, both while he was at work and outside of it, to get to know more about their work and life. “I kept asking him a lot of questions on the nature of his work. I was trying to glean as much inspiration from him as possible. I don’t think I have had to do this much prep work, especially in terms of reading, for any of my roles so far,” she states.\\n\\nInterestingly, the film will also see her turning producer for the first time. “The script demanded a certain kind of budget as it has to be shot on a lot of sets and locations. It is also somewhat dark and intense, and I felt that creative freedom was important if we were to make it that way. These are the kind of subjects that I firmly believe in, and if I don’t support the kind of films that I believe in, then, who will?” she asks.\\n\\n\\nThe cast includes Athulya, Harish Uthaman and Ramesh Khanna among others.

Although she’s done some Telugu films in the meantime, she took her time to pick her next Kannada film. Why? “Being born and brought up here, I am more careful with the Kannada films I pick,” Kruthika says. In a breezy chat, she tells us about her role in Kavacha, what she looks for in films and more…\\nYou play a woman much older than yourself in Kavacha…\\nYes, I play Revathy, who is a woman aged 35-40 years. Director GVR Vasu didn’t want to rely on makeup to make me look older — he wanted me to actually look the part. So, I had to put on 10-12 kgs. And this I had to do in a very short span on time. I had about 1.5 weeks before shooting began, during which time I put on around 8-10 kgs. I managed to do this by cutting out on exercise and eating non-stop. My body is such that I can put on and lose weight easily, so the challenge was to maintain continuity, but not keep putting on more weight.\\n\\n\\nSo, what’s Revathy like? She works in the same apartment complex as Shivarajkumar’s character. She cares for him a lot and is his main pillar of support. They are both mature characters and there is a silent undercurrent between them.\\n\\n\\nHow did Kavacha happen to you?\\n\\nSince the director is from Hyderabad, he had seen my work in Telugu films. He first asked me to watch the original (the Malayalam film Oppam) and tell him if I was ready to play the part. I am quite new to the film industry, so being presented with an opportunity like Kavacha was huge for me. A lot of people asked me why I would want to play someone much older than me this early on in my career, but how do you say no to working with Shivanna?\\n\\n\\nWhy the long break in Sandalwood?\\n\\nI consciously take slow decisions. I get a lot of offers, but I don’t want to do a movie just for the sake of it. I want each movie I do to have some value, and I want to be remembered for them. And I got that with Kavacha. Although I’m not on screen for a long time, I play a key role and add value to the film. Being born and brought up in Bengaluru, I am more careful with the Kannada films I pick.',\n",

In a chat with BT, the actor excitedly talks about his upcoming spy thriller, 'RAW (Romeo, Akbar, Walter)', a story that’s inspired by true events from the 1971 Indo-Pak war, his views on social media activism and how he will always stand up and speak his mind, through his stories on celluloid. Read on...\\nStories that stem from real incidents and significant episodes in history have always interested you ('Madras Café', 'Parmanu: The Story Of Pokhran', and the upcoming 'Batla House'). So, what clinched it specifically for 'RAW'? Also, the mood of the country is different now from what it was a year ago, post the heinous Pulwama attack. Hence, films with a political backdrop need to be doubly sure that they are touching the right chord with the audience. Would you agree?\\nI read the script and I wanted to do it, I knew this was a fantastic story. I was fortunate that Robbie Grewal (writer-director) approached me, though he didn’t expect me to do it. The minute I heard it, I was floored and the first thing I told him was that this is not flaky stuff; the film is so well-researched. Robbie has grown up in an army background; his father was part of the military intelligence, so the subject is close to his heart. Both Robbie and I are intrinsically India lovers. The good thing is that this film is not jingoistic or overtly patriotic. It does not get into the zone of bashing other countries, it is a thriller. Just like 'Raazi', which was after all a human story, this one is, too. Unfortunately for us, the film is releasing post the Pulwama attacks. It has been in the making for a year. In fact, it was always meant to release between March 15 and April 12, you can find it mentioned in the industry trade magazines. We pushed the date ahead to April 5. We know that unfortunately, the film resonates with the mood of the country, but it’s not pre-planned.\\n\\n'RAW' is inspired by true events, and set against the backdrop of the Indo-Pak war of 1971. How much have you personally researched the events that happened during that period? And while doing that, did it throw up interesting insights and give you a different perspective on the subject?\\nWhen I hear stories about wars from people in general, they mostly come from a space of ignorance, pardon me for saying this. In this case, a huge amount of research has gone into the film; I give all credit to Robbie for it. On my part, I think the fact that I am politically aware and I know what has historically happened in the world around us, helps while telling such stories. Subjects like 'Madras Café', 'Parmanu: The Story Of Pokhran', 'Batla House' and 'RAW' is the space that I dwell in. We shot this film in Kashmir, in the middle of a shootout that happened during Eid. We know and understand the mood of the region and are aware of the history of what has happened there for a long time. When you make a film on a sensitive subject, you have to be very responsible in your storytelling. You cannot fudge anything, or take creative liberties, it has to be factual. My biggest source of information was of course, Robbie and all that he had gathered from his father. Other than that, I have read numerous books on the pre-Partition and post-Partition eras. I generally read a lot on such subjects, so if you ask me about what’s happening in Syria, Ecuador, Venezuela or any other part of the world, I am well-informed. I like understanding why there is conflict, where it is coming from and what is the root of it all. You understand all this, process it, and then, when you read Twitter hashtags that tell you… say yes to this, say no to that, I feel bad. You need to have the right information before Tweeting and commenting on such serious issues.\\nYes, social media commentary is common these days and it is often misleading. There is no dearth of armchair activists on social media platforms, people who have an opinion on most issues and dole out advice on various subjects. There are some who genuinely make an impact, but a huge number of them say things out of line to simply draw attention…\\nI would say that it is dangerous. If you are saying something that is sensitive, you rather not say it if you are not backed by the knowledge to comment on the subject. The most dangerous thing in this world is low IQ and high confidence. It can’t get worse than that.\\n\\nWhile you might have strong views on pertinent issues and you are well-informed, one does not see you participating in debates, discussions, or commenting on burning issues (political, social or otherwise) on such forums...\\nI keep telling people that I am not in the business of trending on social media. I do not want to be in a space where I have to be in the news and say something exceptional that will trend. In our line of work, things have changed so much. Earlier, a producer would take you to a hoarding in Juhu and tell you, ‘Look, here is where you are’. Now, the same producer says, ‘Look, you are trending at number one and you are tracking so well’. It might make some actors happy, but I have seen film promotions that have got the fastest 100 million views online, but then, what’s happened to some of those films after they hit the theatres? I feel that a good film will always find its audience. So, my point is, just make a good film, and don’t worry how it is tracking, trending or anything else.\\n\\nYou have backed good films as a producer and made brave choices with movies that went on to make a mark at the box office. Do you think that made industry folks build more faith in you as an actor, too?\\nYes, people take my word for it and I am very responsible with my words. If I tell a certain studio that this content is good, they take my word for it, as they trust my instinct and know that I would be saying the right thing. I think I have worked hard for that. Ever since I turned producer, I have always gone with my instinct and taken risks. We released 'Parmanu: The Story Of Pokhran' during the IPL semi-finals, it was like committing hara-kiri. I had gone through a court case with the producer (Prerna Arora), but I saw that release through and it taught me a lot. I learnt a lot about the legal process and how things work in court. I learnt a lot about distribution and about everything else under the sun. In some of my interviews during that time, I had said that it is very difficult to tell John lies and get away with it. There is nothing that can fool me or will get past me.\\n\\nYou took a strong stand and fought it out in court, and others followed...\\n(Cuts in)… I will always take a stand, even as an actor when I am working on my movies. I am not one of those politically correct actors who is pro-India, but will not say anything that will antagonise anybody. I won’t make a political statement just to trend on social media, but I will say things as they are, as they are meant to be said and I will say it through my films.\\n\\n\\nYou recently said that looking ahead, you can see your best five years coming up (as an actor and producer). The fact that the audience’s appetite for cinema is growing, actors are getting greedier for better and well-written roles and that there is a plethora of options for actors to choose from, has a huge role to play in the benchmark you have set for your career goals. Right?\\n\\nYes, even going ahead, I will only develop content. I will work with the new Ayushmanns (Khurrana) of the world and new directors. I will give them opportunities, and at the end of the day, who will be the hero? The content. Nothing else will drive the film other than good content. I look at it from the audience’s perspective, as I converse a lot with my audience. Why did I become a producer in the first place? For two reasons, firstly, as an actor, I wasn’t getting the kind of films that I wanted to do. Secondly, I wasn’t getting to watch the kind of films I wanted to watch as an audience. If you see my trajectory as an actor before I turned producer and post that, there is a quantum leap. It is because I am doing films which I am convinced that I am meant to do, and I am saying this with all humility. I am a learner, I have learnt through the process. I couldn’t understand the garish performances and overacting that was considered good acting when I first came into the industry, where my subtle acting was considered underacting. People would think, ‘He is not acting’. Today, that subtle acting is considered good. The audience’s tastes have changed and we are at that inflection point, where there is need for content, new-age cinema, subtleties in performances, and everything I am here for.\\n\\n\\nEven while you are doing these content-heavy films, I assume that you would still want to be seen as Action Abraham, the kickass action hero, right? Also, today, the action in our films has gone notches higher (as far as skill, technique and style are concerned). Do you see it scaling up even further?\\nYou could do the best action in this country, but it will not work if you don’t connect emotionally with the story. If the EQ (emotional quotient) is good and the action is average, your film will still do wonders. So, I feel that movies here still run on emotions, not on great action. Think of this…who are your biggest action heroes? Bruce Willis, Sylvester Stallone, Dwayne Johnson, Arnold Schwarzenegger, these are the massive action heroes of Hollywood. What is common between all of them? None of them can really do action…it is their attitude that makes them such huge action heroes. When Arnold says, ‘I will be back’, it’s the way he says it that stays with you. It is the attitude that makes an action hero, not the action itself.\\n\\n\\nGiven how involved you are in every aspect of filmmaking, you must have given some thought to the idea of turning director, too?\\nYes, I have. I will direct someday. I get a lot of hope when I see films directed by artistes like Bradley Cooper, Clint Eastwood and Robert Redford. They are actors who are also such fine directors, they inspire me.\",\n",
    " \"Chuck Russell ‘directed’ a real elephant herd for the first time in his life for 'Junglee'. He tells us that it was very important for him that the elephants were comfortable and happy, which is why he brought no animal trainers along with him for the shoot – the default Hollywood way. Chuck wanted to work only with the elephants and their mahouts, which elicited grim warnings from his Hollywood colleagues. But for the director, the journey which began in fear soon transformed into respect, and then love. “I’ve worked with a guy who’s a legend in Hollywood, Sled Reynolds (animal trainer Paul ‘Sled’ Reynolds) who did 'Tarzan', 'The Ape Man' (1981) with Bo Derek, he did 'The Scorpion King' for me. He was kind of a mentor for me in working with animals, and he told me, ‘Chuck, do not go out there and think you’re the elephant whisperer. They are very dangerous, wild animals’. He wanted me to take some of his trainers with me and he basically made me promise not to get too close to the elephants. Because elephants can kill you accidentally,” says Chuck, and then adds with a chuckle, “I haven’t sent him the trailer yet, ‘coz he’s going to kill me! I did tell him that I wanted to work with the mahouts, and he just... This is the Hollywood thinking, and Sled is a master. But 'Junglee' is a different situation. This is a real herd of elephants, with each having a mahout that stays with his/her elephant for life. So this was a much more naturalistic approach to shooting elephants.”\\n\\n\\nWhat fears did he bring with him? “From the beginning, I knew it was dangerous,” replies Chuck, “Our protocols were developed one step at a time until I felt it was safe. Vidyut was always at the lead because he’s got his own opinion about what is safe, but around the animals, it was only respect. I didn’t tell them when to work, they told me. We earned their trust first, and then I was amazed at the things that happened between them. So it was a slow process, I was there a couple of weeks before we started filming, Vidyut spent a couple of weeks just with Bhola. And then we brought the rest of the crew in.”\\n\\n\\nHe adds, “By the time we were done, we knew what he liked, we knew his apples. Bhola does not let other people approach him. Just his mahout, and Vidyut and fortunately, myself, thanks to the time we spent together. So this was a legit wildlife adventure. I couldn’t do a movie about my love for elephants and the fact that we could lose them, unless the elephants I worked with were truly safe, happy and enjoyed working on our set.”\",\n",
    " \"Hunar Gandhi calls herself a Delhi girl. Her association with the national capital is quite old. The 'Patiala Babes' actress has lived and shot for two shows ('Dahleez' and '12/24 Karol Bagh') in Delhi, and now owns a house in Gurgaon with actor-husband Mayank Gandhi. Although Delhi and Gurgaon are far from similar, to Hunar, it’s all the same. “For those of us who come from Bombay, Gurgaon is Delhi. I still cannot differentiate between the two,” she says, “It has happened so many times that I’d come to our Gurgaon house and someone from my in-laws would say, ‘Main Delhi jaa raha hoon’, and I’d say, ‘Hum Delhi mein hi toh hain’. But now, after spending more time here, I know it’s a separate city.” Hunar laments that she hasn’t explored Gurgaon as much as Delhi. “I know Delhi quite well. I shot in places like Karol Bagh and Chhatarpur, so I know the food and the people very well. But I haven’t had a chance to explore Gurgaon. When I go somewhere new, I always gorge on the city’s food first. The street food shops in Gurgaon will be my first stop.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHunar has some fond memories of shooting in Delhi, particularly the outdoor shoots in Karol Bagh. “I remember we once shot at Ajmal Khan Road with a hidden camera set-up, and it was so fun because people didn’t know we were shooting,” she recounts, adding, “Bas Delhi ki ek baat buri hai. Yahan stalkers bahut aa jaate hain. And I don’t know how, but logon ko yahan phone number bhi badi jaldi mil jaate hain aapke.” On the work front, Hunar’s role of ‘the other woman’ Meeta in 'Patiala Babes', is being appreciated by the audience. She says, “I knew this role had to be different from the usual other women roles you see in soaps, and I’m glad I have been able to bring that out. I wanted her to be a well-rounded human being, and not just shades of black or white. I am happy that it is being appreciated by the audience. When have you ever seen people sympathizing with the other woman in a TV show?”\",\n",
    " 'Television couple Tannaz and Bhakhtyar Irani lived their worst nightmare in the wee hours yesterday, when a part of their bungalow caught fire. The accident took place after the main junction box installed outside the passage blew up. Fortunately, timely intervention averted a major tragedy.\\nThe incident took place around 3.30 am when everyone was asleep. Tannaz shudders as she recalls the incident, “Bhakhtyar and I were sleeping in our room, when our househelp called me from the children’s room, inquiring about the power cut. I asked Bhakhtyar to look into it and within a few minutes of him stepping out, I heard him scream. He is not the one to panic easily. So, I rushed out, and was shocked to see fire in the passage. There were huge flames and smoke reaching inside the house. Fortunately, our neighbour helped us diffuse it by using blankets and kitchen napkins. Bhakhtyar was a real-life hero; he managed to bring the fire down after working relentlessly for 45 minutes. Thankfully, the fire brigade and police also came in time.”\\n\\n\\n\\nThe actress adds, “This has been a big lesson for us. Every home should have a fire extinguisher. Now, we don’t have power supply, and I have sent the kids and dog to my mother-in-law’s home, which is close by, to catch up on some sleep.”\\n\\nTannaz and Bhakhtyar had informed their friends and well-wishers about the accident on social media. On a lighter note, the actress shares, “Given that the incident took place on April 1, many people thought that we were fooling them.

    " 'Finding true relationships —friends or lovers — in general, is hard. While you might find a good friend or true lover by hanging out with him or her in person, people often wonder if having a network of contacts on social media, who you have never met, can be called friends, too. Are social media relations as deep and meaningful as long-standing friendships in the real world?\\n\\nWith the soaring popularity of such platforms, people tend to communicate less in person and more online. According to a recent American study, 76 per cent teenagers use social media. While some might assume that online relationships are transient, fleeting and shallow, others feel that sometimes you can be more honest with a social media friend, than communicating with someone directly. That’s because, though the mediums are different, the bond you share with someone online is as intense as it would be with someone you meet.\\n“Social media and dating apps are excellent avenues to find new companions. But often, it is equated to finding a friend with benefits. If you find someone who seems genuine, make sure you don’t get physically or financially involved. Be it friendship or love, it’s best to take things slow, initially,” says Dr Rohann Bokdawala, psychiatrist.\\n\\nTrust is the key\\nEven when you communicate with someone on a digital medium, there’s still human interaction. If you like talking to someone on social media and you share common interests and topics you’re passionate about, you may have found a true relation.\\n\\n\\n\\nCity-based Anuradha Tiwari has been friends with Saemah Khan for over a decade. They connected on a social networking site via a mutual friend and their bond turned into long-lasting friendship. “Saemah is like a sister to me. When we interacted for the first time, we argued over a mutual friend’s post. But later, we clicked and became best of friends. We met for the first time at Bandra station for five minutes, and bonded well. We have been by each other’s side through thick and thin. Her family loves me and vice versa,” says Anuradha, who feels that trust, time and patience are the key ingredients for finding the right bond on social media.\\n\\nExperts say it’s important to trust your gut when you are bonding with a person on social media. If you like talking to him or her, be frank about who you are. You can’t start a friendship or bond based on pretenses. Saemah says that their mutual understanding and willingness to hear each other out worked when they connected on a social networking site. Explaining how they trusted each other, Saemah adds, “When we realised that we don’t judge each other for what we say or opine, the trust strengthened. I feel every bond, whether it’s with someone you meet regularly or a social media contact, takes time. So, we started meeting occasionally, mostly on birthdays, and our friendship bloomed with every meeting. I loved her honesty and our wavelength matched.”\\n\\nIs it love?\\nWhile some find true friends on social media, some find true love and subsequent life partners, too. Pooja Advani, a PR professional from Mumbai, connected with Omkar Pawaskar on social media in 2015. They fell in love and eventually, got married.\\n\\n\\n\\n“We met after chatting for a month on the site. The first meeting was awkward for both of us, but we got along in subsequent meetings. We realised that our choices in terms of food and music, and expectations from life, were similar. We were always transparent in the relationship when we chatted on social media, and that reflected when we met, too,” says Pooja.\\n\\n\\nAnother Mumbaikar, Tanya Chopra connected with Rahul Sharma on a dating app. She never knew that she would end up marrying the guy. “I connected with Rahul in 2014. I was speaking to another guy at the same time and had spoken to a couple of them before as well. After a point, the conversation gets boring with the repeated questions, like ‘How are you?’ and ‘What are your hobbies?’ It’s the same drill. But with Rahul, it was different. He didn’t start the conversation with the usual. He asked me what my political views were, what I am like as a person. His knowledge and intelligence intrigued me and made me want to know him more,” she says.\\n\\n\\nDon’t play around\\nIt’s important to stay patient and not play around with sentiments on social networking sites if you want to find a true relationship. “When you start a relationship online, you have doubts. I was skeptical when Rahul and I started talking, because some men I connected with offered to meet me in my building at midnight after a 5-minute conversation. There were some who asked for my personal number a few seconds after connecting on social media. But Rahul did none of this. He gave me the time to get comfortable talking to him and opening up to him. We developed a strong bond and trust, and now, we are married,” says Tanya.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIf your areas of interest are common and your wavelengths match, striking a bond isn’t difficult. City-based celebrity manager Mona Jaswani found one of her closest friends four years ago on a photo-sharing social network. They bonded over their common spiritual beliefs. “We connected over spirituality, something which is quite unconventional when it comes to the younger generation. After knowing each other for a while, we realised that both of us were looking for a companion to connect with on the spiritual front. We didn’t exchange numbers and continued to chat on the site for months. The first time he invited me to meet was at a satsang (prayer meeting). I was surprised. We started going on walks and the topics we discussed included Lord Shiva, work and fitness,” she says.',\n",

    " \"At 55, Aasif Sheikh is in an enviable position. While many of his peers have either been relegated to doing insignificant roles, or faded into oblivion, the actor has managed to stay relevant. Defying the norm of younger faces playing heroes on TV, Aasif is the lead on the show, 'Bhabiji Ghar Par Hai!'\\nHe says, “The show has given me a new lease of life. Usually, an actor my age makes peace with the fact that he would be reduced to playing just papa and chacha on screen. I was also losing hope and had in a way prepared myself to wear the usual kurta pajama and stand behind an array of actors. However, I would still pray to God for that one opportunity where I had the scope to perform. A meaty role like Vibhuti’s (his character in 'Bhabiji...') is unthinkable. My life revolves around this show. I reach home after the shoot, spend an hour with my family over dinner, hit the bed and go back to work the next day. But they all understand that it is worth the effort.”\\n\\nHe adds, “My kids tell me to take it easy and slow down because I am 55 and yet running around. I tell them that I can’t. Jo kabhi zindagi mein nahi mila hai, woh ab mil raha hai. How can I slow down now? I have earned name, fame and money through this show. I will act till the time I can remember my lines.”\\n\\nBesides Vibhuti, Aasif has played over 250 characters and around 20 variations of a woman on the show. It’s the variety in the role that keeps him on his toes. He says, “Among other female characters, I have played Amrapali and a Chinese woman. After 1,200 episodes, there isn’t much left in the story to explore, so, we explore the characters. It’s always funny to see a man transform into a woman and I look good as a woman (laughs!). I have all shapes and sizes of clothes required to become a woman stored in my make-up room. In fact, my wife inquired about the eight pairs of sandals in my room when she visited the set once and I told her that they belonged to me. She was scandalised. I can play the quintessential heroine for a few episodes on a daily soap (laughs!). It takes me around four hours to dress like a woman, as I am very particular about my look. I sit with the team to finalise the look of the character I am playing.”\\n\\n\\nThe actor featured as a hero in films like 'Rama O Rama' (1988) and 'Yaara Dildara' (1991) and then hit a low. But he has no regrets over the slow phase in his career. He shares, “I like to move on and not regret anything in life. I started as a hero and did a few films, but there was no work for a few years. I played negative characters and bagged a role in 'Karan Arjun' (1995), which changed my life for the better. Life is a journey and I like to enjoy it. Earlier, I was seen as a decent performer, but this show has put me on a pedestal. It’s an overwhelming feeling. I am proud of what I am doing at this age. Ab return mil raha hai saalon ke hard work ka.”\\n\\n\\nWhile several youngsters prefer to take up finite shows after a long stint on a daily soap, Aasif says, “The idea to leave Bhabiji... has never crossed my mind. Finite or infinite, actors need to understand that they are playing characters on TV. It’s up to them to keep themselves amused and immersed in the character. I have been doing that since four years.”\\n\\n\\nThe show hit a roadblock when Shilpa Shinde, the original Angoori bhabhi, decided to quit the show three years ago. Aasif says, “I was the one who recommended Shilpa for that role. I had worked with her for a month on 'Chidiyaghar' and believed that she fit the bill. It was indeed a difficult time when she quit the show. But let me tell you, no one is indispensable on TV. The show will go on, maybe, the number of eyeballs will decrease. Things became alright after Shubhangi Atre joined as the new Angoori bhabhi. I feel the content makes a show and not just one character. Logon ke saath saath Shilpa ki bhi galat fehmi thi ki ek character show ko chalaata hai. She even told me, ‘I am the one who runs the show. Mere jaane ke baad show dekhna band ho jayega’. I told her that it was her biggest mistake to think like that. I am assuming she was being misguided by people. Of course, she was the most popular character on the show and her exit hit us. It took us around four months to recover.”\",\n",

    " 'Stan Lee may not be here to see Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU)) complete an important milestone with the release of \\'Avengers: Endgame\\', but director Joe Russo on Monday told Indian fans that being a part of the world created by the comic genius was a dream come true for him.\\n\\nLee passed away on November 12 at 95, and Russo said \\'Endgame\\' has one of his final cameo appearances.\\n\\n\\n\"I wouldn\\'t be standing here without him. I believe one of his final cameo is in \\'Endgame.\\' I don\\'t remember if he was well enough to do the Spider-Man cameo. But it was incredible,\" Russo said at the launch of the Hindi version of the Marvel Anthem composed by music maestro A R Rahman, who was also present at the event.\\nThe Tamil and Telugu versions will release soon.\\n\\n\"I grew up on his comic books. Stan Lee was my idol when I was a kid. To be able to have the opportunity to not only work on the material that he created but to work with him is a childhood dream come true,\" he added.\\n\\nThe makers for the film, including the Marvel Studios bosses, have always been strict with their \\'no spoilers\\' policy and Russo appealed to the fans to not kill the movie for others as it is a product of seven years of hardwork.\\n\\n\"Thanos demands your silence,\" he quipped.\\n\\nThe director told fans to be prepared for \"more stakes\" after the finger snap by Thanos wiped out half of the population of the world including some of the superheroes.\\n\\nMark Ruffalo, who plays the Hulk in the MCU, had famously blurted out the end of \\'Infinity War\\' and Russo revealed that this time they took extra measures to protect the secrets, including not sharing the script with the cast.\\n\\n\"Here\\'s the thing. I\\'ll take any questions about \\'Endgame\\' but I\\'m not going to answer any question on the plot of \\'Endgame\\'! Three years of protecting the plot from Tom Holland and Mark Ruffalo, so I\\'m not going to stand here and give away about the film. But I appreciate and admire your effort,\" he said.\\n\\nThe director acknowledged the fan mania around the films by saying, \"Here is the thing about Marvel fans, they read between the lines in everything\".\\n\\nTalking about how they protected the secrets from Holland, who had in the past accidentally shared the details about his upcoming film \\'Spider-Man: Far From Home\\', Russo said they never gave the script to the young actor.\\n\\n\"Tom Holland does not get the script! He gets his lines, and that\\'s all, along with who is acting opposite him. Then we use very vague terms to describe what\\'s happening in the scene,\" he added.\\n\\nPraising the Indian version of the Marvel Anthem, Russo said he had \"goosebumps\" when he first heard the track.\\n\\n\"I felt it represented the spirit of he film, which you can\\'t express in words. Which is why Rahman is a musical genius.\"\\n\\nThe Oscar-winning composer said creating the anthem for the Avengers was an honour for him.\\n\\n\"It was a great honour to compose this track for Avengers India. When I was briefed about the story, it resonated with me.\"\\n\\n\\nHe added that his son helped him in understanding the spirit of the Marvel superheroes.\\n\"My son is a bigger fan of Marvel than I am. So I went to him and asked, \\'what do you think?\\' he said \\'good daddy!\\' I look at his eyes and find the spirit.\"\\n\\n\"My favourite Marvel superheroes are Iron Man and Black Panther. Favourite superhero movie would be \\'Black Panther\\', because it\\'s new.\"\\n\\nWhen asked if \\'Endgame\\' composer Alan Silvestri gave him some input for the song, Rahman said, \"No. This entire track was conceived, reviewed and shot here in ten days. I didn\\'t show it him. He finished his score just recently is what I believe. This song is for the Indian audience.\"\\n\\nRusso, who has co-directed \\'Endgame\\' with brother Anthony, is in India to promote \"Endgame\". The movies mark the final film within the MCU\\'s current generation of superheroes.\\n\\n\\nIt features an ensemble cast of Robert Downey Jr, Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Don Cheadle, Paul Rudd, Brie Larson, Karen Gillan, Danai Gurira, Bradley Cooper, Tessa Thompson and Josh Brolin\\n\\n\\n\\'Endgame\\' will hit the theatres in India on April 26 in English, Hindi, Tamil and Telugu.']\n",

Also reminiscing his time on the sets, he says, “It was as if I was working with my family on the film.” The trailer of the film will be launched online on Ugadi.\n",

      "Zinia Sen\n",
      "Movies\n",
      "Only three weeks back, everything seemed normal. Dipen Mitra, the proprietor of Mitra cinema — an iconic theatre in north Kolkata — turned up in crisp white dhoti-kurta and wore a smile to greet a motley group of movie lovers. He offered a platter of korapaaker sandesh and said it would be a huge loss for those who didn’t savour them. He showed rare pictures of old Kolkata and reminisced the golden era of Bengali cinema. Though he didn’t speak of his decision to close the theatre that day, he did say he was concerned about what would happen to it after he’s gone. The theatre, which was earlier known as Chitra cinema, changed hands and began its journey as Mitra in 1963. After decades of running movies of Satyajit Ray, Mrinal Sen, Ritwik Ghatak and many contemporaries, it downed shutters at the beginning of the month. With it, more single screens seem to be staring at a bleak future. In a brief chat, Dipen Mitra talks about his decision that has proved how April is indeed the cruellest month. Excerpts:\n",
      "What made you decide to down shutters?\n",
      "\n",
      "As we speak, I’m sitting at a hospital for a check-up. I’ve been ailing for quite some time now and didn’t want to pass my burden onto others. When people ask me, ‘How are you doing Dipenda?’, I tell them, ‘First class!’ But I’ve developed quite a few problems. I invested `20 lakh recently to renovate the theatre, but health issues started cropping up one after the other.\n",
      "What about your family?\n",
      "\n",
      "I asked my sister-in-law about the problem. She too isn’t keeping well and can’t walk much. Then I asked my nephew if he would take responsibility of the theatre. My mother didn’t get me married. I had told her many times that fix a match for me, but that never happened (laughs). But she left me without foreseeing this future. Jokes apart, I asked my nephew, who is a chartered accountant and lives in Gurgaon. He has a demanding job and he clearly told me neither could he shift here nor did the family business interest him. He said he would ask a legal firm to look into the matter. What I realised after talking to them was that my employees would incur great losses if they took charge. I called my employees and asked them, ‘Tora ki korbi bol?’ They said they were ready to sign legal papers should I ask them to. I spoke to the lawyers and drafted an MoU. I summoned an employee and asked him to read it out to the rest. ‘Tui toh porashona korechhish, pore shona,’ I told him. He said if I’d read it, they had no problems with it. They left the papers on my table. I’ve cleared all their dues. They said, ‘Sir, apni ki korben?’ They are worried about me. Frankly, if anyone wants to run this theatre, I’d be more than happy.\n",
      "\n",
      "What do you plan to do with the theatre?\n",
      "\n",
      "As of now, I don’t know. My nephew has asked me to sell it off. I am 75. At this age, I’m not getting married and I don’t need to worry about my wife or kids! My brother passed away at an early age. All I have is my sister-in-law, nephew and his family.\n",
      "\n",
      "Will you from now on lead a retired life?\n",
      "\n",
      "I was never into any service, so there’s no question of retirement. I have nothing to gain or lose. About what I’ll do in future, only time will tell. See, my idea was never to close this theatre. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have spent a huge amount on changing the transformer and upgrading the sound system. Only this morning, the air-conditioner maintenance person turned up at my door. Till I’m alive, I’ll keep maintaining the building. I am worried about my employees.\n",
      "\n",
      "What was the last running film?\n",
      "\n",
      "Kesari. A lot of people are writing on social media that Mitra is turning into a mall, but fact is, I haven’t sold the theatre yet. These days, rumours spread very fast. Someone asked me why I was going to a hospital in the morning and said he would fix up an appointment with a cardiac surgeon. I said I don’t have a heart problem. I don’t know why people can’t let others be!\n",

When my first film, Waarish, released, he had come for its private screening at a south Kolkata theatre. He was so moved that he blessed me for the film. I’ve been to his theatre for many films. Nagarkirtan was running there recently and I visited the theatre after Drishtikone’s release last year. Every time I went there, he would treat me to cutlets. Fact is, single screens are losing out to plexes in Kolkata. They can’t give the wholesome experiences that plexes can now give — there’s no window-shopping involved and it doesn’t give you the false feeling of a Singapore trip. It’s very sad for Bengali cinema and I just hope the theatre reopens soon.\n",

I knew the film could not be accommodated in Mitra and the team was heartbroken. Some of my films like Sudhu Tumi and Cross Connection have run there. I’d often visit the place and tell Dipenda, ‘Get married now.’ It’s such a theatre where Mon Janena can run, much like Cross Connection or Haami. So, it’s a mixed audience. For me, it’d be a reality check every time I went there. Dipenda doesn’t mince words and he’d tell me where a film stood. This is a huge blow for Bengali cinema.\n",

      "Meet Bengaluru's acid attack survivor who is an inspiration to many\n",
      "Joyeeta Chakravorty\n",
      "-\n",
      "In 2006, a beautiful 23-year-old Pragya Prasun was subjected to her worst nightmare. Barely 10 days after she got married, a jilted lover threw acid on her face. Ever since, her life has been about accepting the truth and trying to move ahead. Now, 35-year-old Pragya, who recently won the Nari Shakti Puraskar — the highest civilian award given to women in India — talks to us about her journey from a meek and conflicted acid attack victim to a survivor and a beacon of hope for many.\n",
      "‘My foundation was born out of my greatest sorrow’\n",
      "Her struggle with burns and rehabilitation made Pragya rethink her life goals. “I was lucky to be from an educated and a financially-stable family, who asked the right questions. But while I was undergoing treatment in hospital, I saw a lot of burn victims, who were losing hope, as there was no one to guide them. So, I decided to help them. I started guiding them to the right doctor and giving them information about their diet and the treatments for scars,” she says. In a bid to help burn victims ask the right question and seek help at the right places, Pragya started an NGO, which has rehabilitated more than 200 acid attack victims across the country. From guiding patients to conducting burn camps, where nearly 25 surgeries for burns patients across the country are done in 3-4 days, her foundation (started in 2013) has come a long way. “Other than that, we get surgeries done for the patients one by one or in a group of 2-3 patients throughout the year in Bengaluru, Chennai, Delhi and Mumbai. The surgery count goes up till 3-4 each month. For four years, we have also been getting laser treatment and hair transplant done for 1-2 patients every month,” she adds.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I tried to push my husband away’\n",
      "With 47% burns and hypertrophic scars all over, it was anything but easy going for Pragya after the attack. “I was a newly-married woman and barely 12 days into my marital life when I was attacked. To look at myself like that in the mirror impacted me deeply. I thought that my marriage would not sustain, as the first three years were difficult. I felt guilty about messing up my husband’s life and I tried to push him away. But he has been very supportive and has taken good care of me,” says Pragya. “I had suffered two miscarriages and was not in a good mind space, but after my first daughter was born in 2009, my life changed. She was the positivity in my life,” she says.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘It is definitely not easy for my daughter’\n",
      "\n",
      "But even with a positive family, all has not been rosy for Pragya or her two daughters, as society has been harsh on them. “It used to be extremely difficult to just take my daughters to the playground or drop them at school, as parents would look away from us and even pull their children away. At school, my daughters are asked, ‘Why does your mother look like a ghost?’ But both my daughters are now strong and have developed coping skills,”\n",
      "\n",
      "says Pragya, who feels that society is yet to become more accepting of acid attack victims.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Hope Chappak makes people more accepting of acid attack survivors’\n",
      "\n",
      "This is why Pragya hopes that Deepika Padukone’s film with Meghna Gulzar, titled Chappak, is a changemaker. Chappak is based on an acid attack survivor. “I am glad that Deepika and a seasoned director like Meghna Gulzar have picked the issue of acid attacks as a subject for their film. I was amazed to see the first look. At the same time, I lament that the makeup Deepika wore for the movie is an everyday reality for many like me. I\n",
      "\n",
      "sincerely hope that the way people accept her in the movie is how they accept real-life survivors. I hope that the awareness this creates highlights the menace of acid attack in the society and is, therefore, eradicated from our world forever.”\n",

      "-\n",
      "What should have been a regular gig on Saturday night for Bengaluru-based stand-up comic Akshay Laxman at a city hot spot turned out to be quite the nightmare for him. “I was the last act that evening and there were a couple of disgruntled audience members who wanted some of the earlier comics to apologise for a few jokes. When it didn’t happen, one of them flung a beer mug at me,” Akshay recalls, adding that he is set to file a complaint against the offender. “This was a night that came with a prior warning. It was called Undressed Comedy and the guests knew that there would be some sexually explicit jokes. Through the course of the night, there were some jokes that centred on pedophilia,” explains Akshay.\n",
      "\n",
      "Akshay adds. “I guess the jokes got the better of them and since I was the last act, they tried to ask for some kind of an apology, but seeing none coming, the mug was hurled at me in frustration.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The incident was shared by Akshay on his Facebook page, which was how many other comics heard of it and then condemned the act. Sanjay Manaktala points out, “It is not uncommon for someone to take offence to jokes. But the best feedback in comedy is laughter and these guys could have kept quiet. Inciting violence is definitely not right. And the people who are being accused here are definitely not uneducated. I have seen a similar incident once. I was waiting for my turn for a show in Singapore, where there was another person on stage before me. He was making fun of Australians and their drinking habits, when one of the members took offence and threw a beer bottle. The audience member, luckily for me, was taken out before I went on stage. But at such shows, it is hard to know when someone is offended and how they would react.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Danish Sait, too, adds that this incident is unacceptable. “People need to stop being righteous. When they have gone to a night that has stand-up comedy, they understand that comedy is a heightened state of a regular situation. If one doesn’t agree to the jokes, the best is to get up and leave. Just because one has paid, no one will dance to your tunes. A comic usually prepares a set of jokes that he likes. Hecklers, who are just trolls from the online world in real life, are always around,” he adds.\n",
      "\n",
      "But how does one learn to handle these hecklers? “It takes a lot of practice. I have seen a lot of senior comics like Sorabh Pant go from ignoring to addressing them to now just asking them to shut up and not ruin the show,” says Danish. Sanjay adds, “Another thing most comics end up doing is building their own network. All of us have friends in the legal sector and other corporate bodies.”\n",

If a record label says that they want this particular thing, one has to do it or else someone else will do it,” says Gourov. But doesn’t that curtail the freedom of a music composer? “It does.

      "Sandra Marina Fernandes\n",
      "Fitness Tips\n",
      "In today’s day and age where body-shaming has become a matter of concern, millennials are taking their fitness seriously. With different exercising techniques and diets, college students are fitter than ever and leave no stone unturned to look and feel their best.\n",
      "Hitting the gym and indulging in sporting activities\n",
      "For many city students, hitting the gym on a daily basis is a must and this is due to various reasons. “I go to the gym daily and spend at least two hours in there. I was into sports when I was in school and once I came to college, I didn’t want to lose touch with my physical activities. So, I began hitting the gym. In addition to this, I run as well,” says Tarun Kumar, a student of Presidency University. Students don’t just hit the gym, but do exercises depending on their strengths and their goals. “I like to lift weights. I was doing functional training, but realised that I couldn’t do a handstand. I was also losing a lot of weight because I wasn’t eating right. That’s when I stopped functional training and started lifting weights and saw the difference,” says Greeshma Ramesh, a student of St. Joseph’s College of Commerce, who hits the gym six days a week. Today, students love to experiment with different exercising techniques. “I indulge in different forms of workouts like power yoga, aerobics, Tabata and more,” says Preksha Vijay, a student of Nitte Meenakshi Institute of Technology.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Diet plays a crucial role\n",
      "\n",
      "If you exercise regularly, but don’t follow a diet, it doesn’t serve the purpose, say students, which is why they too follow a strict diet based on their exercise routine. “Diet is a very important aspect of one’s fitness regime. For example, other than hitting the gym, I follow intermittent fasting with a keto diet. Keto requires you to replace carbs with fat. Intermittent fasting is where one fasts for 16 hours and consumes meals in the eight hour window,” says Preksha.\n",
      "\n",
      "But following a diet is not easy and cheat days too are done keeping in mind the repercussions. “People say that most of your fitness regime is mostly 30% workout and 70% diet. So yes, diet is important, especially when you’re building muscles. I consume calorie-surplus food and make sure that I consume a particular amount of calories every day,” says Tarun, adding that chicken, eggs and other natural proteins are included in his diet on a daily basis. “Following a diet is hard because calories matter and it’s not easy. Even when I have a cheat day, it has to be calories-based. I cannot go overboard. My diet is specific; I consume brown rice, brown bread and chicken breast, in addition to other things,” says Greeshma.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Exercising doesn’t come cheap\n",
      "\n",
      "Gym subscriptions and following diets are a costly affair and students spend anywhere between `7,000 to `10,000 a month for this. “Along with training fees, protein shakes and supplements, my every month expenditure on my fitness routine is approximately `7,000,” says Preksha. Similarly, Greeshma says that since she follows a strict diet, it does cost her a lot every month. “Since protein powders are expensive, the overall cost of my fitness regime automatically goes up. Since I like having chicken and eggs every day, my per month expenses are anywhere between `5,000 and 7,000,” Greeshma sums up.\n",

      "Actress and kathak dancer Prachee Shah Paandya known for her roles in serials like 'Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi', 'Iss Pyaar Ko Kya Naam Doon..Ek Baar Phir' and more was in Lucknow recently for an event. The actress, who was part of the film 'Mulk' which was shot extensively in Lucknow, says that Lucknow somehow brings out her artistic personality. \"I shot for 'Mulk' which was for around 21 days and starting from having nawabi cuisines on set to chikan shopping, everything was just amazing, I really enjoyed myself. I feel that Lucknow actually brings out the artist in me. Of course, my journey started with Lucknow and Jaipur where I used to come and do stage shows. I feel that somewhere, Lucknow se mera pichhle janm ka naata hai. It has a great vibe and I love wearing chikan suits. I think, given a choice for 365 days I can wear chikan suits and saris. I am not a jeans and a western attire person, so I am happy wearing a chikan kurta and sharara which I think suits me the best. I love the whole feel of the place.\" The kathak danseuse and actress who recently lost her guru Ganesh Hiralal ji, of the seventh generation of the Hiralal family of the Jaipur gharana, feels that she has not just lost her guru but someone who taught her to live through dance. Talking about it and getting emotional at the same time, Prachee says, \"The emotions are coming out in bouts because this morning when I woke up I had no one to talk to. He was 82 and for two years he had congestion in his chest. Who would have thought that one day I would wake up and not find him around me. He was someone who was more of a father figure rather than a guru.\"\n",

      "Prachee with her guru late Ganesh Hiralalji (BCCL/ Aditya Yadav)\n",
      "\n",
      "She adds, \"I haven’t lost a guru, I have lost my soul! I have learnt kathak for about 25 years and maine hamesha se one-on-one seekha hai. I have not attended any class so that bond was even more special. He was 82-years-old and one would not believe that he had performed on vocal padhanth with me till last year in all major festivals whether in India or abroad. So the thought that he is not around is still difficult for me to take in. My father and my husband were there during the funeral ceremony and they kept on sending me pictures, and I was crying continuously. I still can’t imagine that I have lost him because he is somebody who moulded me as a human being right from the way I project myself, the way I dress up and the way I talk. Unka hamesha se kehna tha ki ‘kaam bolna chahiye’, he never believed in outer appearances.\" Adding, she says, \"The moment you are on stage whether it is for three hours or three minutes, it’s your entry that says it all. These were his words. The only strength I get while I am on stage is the fact that he is there with me on stage who can easily handle my flaws. And despite being a guru, he never overpowered me on stage. He said that ‘this is your stage, you make the laye, you make the rhythm, you conduct the show and I am there to guide you’. I mean which guru does that? I feel that I am thoroughly blessed to have him in his life. It’s been 25 years and all major festivals in the country or abroad, I have travelled everywhere with him and not once did he say ki ‘main thak gaya hoon ya mujhse nahi hoga’. He was the simplest man who was happy having daal, chawal, roti, sabzi and ice cream was his favourite dessert.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Now I really don’t know how will I be on stage, the fact that he will not be present to teach me and guide me is frightening. All these years he has seen me enter into the phase of a wife to a mother and been there when I was expecting my first child. The entire spiritual aspect in me is totally because of him because he was so spiritual,\" adds the actress who has also done films like Judwaa 2 and Student of The Year. The actress shares that the transition from television to film has been more difficult for her. Talking about her role in Mulk, Prachee says the film gave her a strong recognition in the film fraternity. \"I have been a part of television for more than 20 years so to kind of give you a breakthrough in films with a performance oriented role, I think Mulk has kind of started it for me. And now I can hope to do better films. I have done a complete commercial film like 'Judwaa 2' with David Dhawan ji, which sometimes amazes me ki I have done that film. I fall in such an age group where I neither look 45-50 years old nor 25-30. That is a reason I get to play the roles of mother and I believe playing a mother has a more wide range to it and a longer run career wise. So I am happy I got to do a film like Mulk which challenged me as an actor,\" says Prachee, who says she would love to experiment more with such roles.\n",

For a whole global generation of film goers, these movies have become very important. They are a part of their growing up years and pop culture. The best of these movies tell compelling stories about humans, who happen to have powers. The powers are secondary to the experiences of characters as people and the choices that they make.

The energy and effort he puts into his work every second and the way he approaches his character and believes what it is, the way he shows up on set everyday, the level of intensity he brings to his work ethic — it’s commendable.

      "Last Friday, those who were eagerly waiting to watch 'Hotel Mumbai' were surprised to see its shows suddenly go missing, even after the film’s worldwide release date was confirmed as March 29. Directed by Anthony Maras, and starring Anupam Kher, Dev Patel, Armie Hammer and Nazanin Boniadi, the film shows the experiences of the trapped hotel guests and staff as armed terrorists stormed the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel during the Mumbai terror attacks in 2008.\n",
      "The film’s team is staying mum on why it skipped its originally-scheduled India release, and the silence has led many distributors to speculate that the reason could be its “sensitive content”, while other industry insiders suspect that with the post-Pulwama tensions and upcoming elections, it was bad timing. But turns out, the reason behind the silence is, in fact, a legal deadlock.\n",
      "Separately, the film was pulled out of theatres in Australia and New Zealand after the mass shooting in Christchurch “out of respect for a country in mourning”, the film’s New Zealand distributor had said. But no official reason has been given for the film missing its India release.\n",

Shaaminder Mallik, a Delhi-based distributor, tells us, “The film was not released on the scheduled date because it couldn’t find any distributors in India. Indian distributors have their own apprehensions about a film which is also giving narrative space to terrorists.”\n",
      "Another Delhi-based distributor, without wishing to be named, tells us, “We are not sure of the exact reasons the film didn’t release, but our information is that no distributors bought the film because of the sensitive nature of the content. There were reports that the film also attempts to humanise the terrorists. Should the film be released in India in the current scenario? With elections next month, we didn’t want to take the risk of protests and vandalism in theatres.

      "A few days ago, it was reported that Plus Holdings, a Dubai-based company, took Netflix Global, Hotel Mumbai PTY LTD, Arclight Films and Xeitgeist Entertainment Group to the Bombay High Court over who had the rights to release the film in the SAARC region. Plus Holdings claimed that they had the original rights, which they had bought from Xeitgeist Entertainment Group, and moved the Bombay HC to stop Netflix from releasing the film. Netflix has since informed the court that its rights to show Hotel Mumbai on its platform have been terminated by Hotel Mumbai PTY Ltd (HMPL). They then sought to be deleted as a respondent party in the suit which was accepted by the HC. When contacted, Netflix declined to comment, saying that the matter was sub judice. Sources close to Netflix confirmed to DT that they will not be releasing the film in India, and they have nothing to do with the film now. But even though Netflix is no longer associated with the film, Plus Holdings cannot release the film yet, according to the court order.\n",
      "Sandeep S Ladda, the lawyer representing Plus Holdings, told us their version of the case. We take you through the case step-by-step.\n",
      "Over the dispute of distribution rights, Ladda filed a petition in the Bombay HC in February to stop Netflix from releasing the film in the SAARC territory. He claimed that Plus Holdings had bought the rights from Xeitgeist. The lawyer alleged that Xeitgeist then unlawfully transferred the movie’s rights to Netflix through a third party last year. However, it was revealed in court that “when the agreement was entered into between Plus Holdings and Xeitgeist, the SAARC distribution rights were held by Xeitgeist, but the agreement was later terminated and the distribution rights reverted to HMPL, the original owner of the film. Later, HMPL entered into an agreement with Netflix, which was also later terminated by HMPL.” Therefore, Xeitgeist contended that it was “powerless to stop HMPL or Netflix”.\n",
      "\n",
      "Plus Holdings’ lawyer appealed to the Bombay HC to stop Netflix from releasing the film, saying that they had exclusive rights to release the film in the Indian subcontinent. Plus Holdings asked the court to restrain Netflix, Xeitgeist, HMPL and other associated parties that it listed in its petition from claiming any rights to the film in India till the time an ongoing dispute between itself and Xeitgeist is being adjudicated upon by a Singapore arbitration court. In a hearing on March 7, the Bombay High Court restrained HMPL from entering into any agreement related to the movie Hotel Mumbai. The matter has now been adjourned till April 4.\n",

      "The March 7 order of the Bombay HC states, “In such a situation, whether Xeitgeist at all had any rights to be assigned in favour of HMPL and whether it can be said that Xeitgeist would be legitimately entitled to any rights of exhibitions of the film in question for the SAARC countries would be required to be considered.” Also, the court order states that HMPL, to whom the rights of the film for SAARC were reverted post contract-cancellation, did not appear in the court on March 7, and as stated above, even though HMPL holds all the rights to the film, it has been restrained from “entering into any agreement” regarding the film.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sources close to the case say that Plus Holdings will continue to seek to block the release of the movie in India through any other channel as it holds exclusive broadcasting and other rights. Ladda confirmed to us, “My client is ready and willing to exercise their rights to distribute the film in India as well in other countries as per contract.” However, he refused to respond if Plus Holdings is in talks with any Indian exhibitor or distributor for the release of the film.\n",

Sonyaa says, “I feel that surname gives away not just your caste, but also your standing in the social order. Sometimes, it reflects a person’s economic status as well. I find it absurd. I don’t believe in anything that discriminates humans, be it religion or caste. I strongly feel that surname should not be used as a benchmark to check whether someone is superior or not.

Hold on for as long as you can and repeat on the other side.\n",

      "Looks like the curious case of missing Dayaben aka Disha Vakani of 'Taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah', will soon be solved. The actress, who went on a maternity break in September 2017, has not yet decided whether she will return to the show that made her a household name.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the makers of the show are in no mood to wait longer. Producer Asit Kumarr Modi told BT, “I will have to start looking for a new Dayaben. No one is bigger than the show. Taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah will go on with a new face, because the family is incomplete without Dayaben.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Modi also added how his team has waited enough for Disha. He said, “So many working women in the country get pregnant, go on a maternity break, have babies and resume their jobs. Today, women continue to work even after having babies. We have given Disha leave, but we cannot wait forever. Having said that, replacing an actress is not an overnight process. The track has to be planned months in advance. Right now, we have started the initial process of auditioning for the character. We are still not sure what will happen in the future, but I would like to reiterate that the show must go on.”\n",

      "TNN / Apr 3, 2019, 04:00 IST\n",
      "BUSINESS NEWS\n",
      "Bengaluru: Rajan Anandan, the India and Southeast Asia chief at Google, is leaving the firm after an eight-year stint. He will join top Silicon Valley venture capital (VC) firm Sequoia Capital’s India unit as managing director. The move is likely to be a booster for the startup ecosystem as Anandan will head an initiative launched by the VC firm to back very early stage startups both in India and Southeast Asia. Additionally, Anandan has been a prolific investor in early stage companies personally and is one of the early evangelists of the local internet market.\n",
      "He will leave Google by the end of the month and is expected to join Sequoia Capital by the second half of the year, continuing to be based out of Delhi. His move comes after a rejig at Google’s operations in the region where Asia-Pacific head Karim Temsamani stepped down in December and was replaced by Greater China and Korea head Scott Beaumont in March.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anandan’s exit will be a loss to Google as he scaled operations of the company to about $1.3 billion in revenues and was one of the biggest proponents of India’s digital story to the company’s brass. He had said that the next wave of internet consumption will be defined by three themes — voice, video and vernacular — that would catapult millions of new users to consume internet, launching new products targeted at these consumers. Voice queries and vernacular are expected to drive traffic as the number of Indian language users is expected to cross 500 million within two years.\n",
      "Google India’s country director for sales Vikas Agnihotri will take over as the interim head, according to a statement. “Digital economy in India+SEA: $125B in 2018. 30%++ yoy (year on year) growth (revenues, not users). $500B addressable market by 2023. There simply has not been a better time to #startup in India and SEA!” 50-year-old Anandan tweeted about his move to Sequoia, where he will focused on leading its accelerator initiative Surge.\n",

      "Sequoia had launched its Surge earlier this year where it plans to pick up 10–20 early stage startups twice every year and invest $1.5 million in each of them at the start of the programme. The new initiative, where Sequoia is likely to invest more than $100 million over the next four-five years, may also lead to the launch of a new fund, two sources had told TOI when the programme was launched. “Rajan’s deep understanding of technology, significant operating expertise and track record of growing tech businesses across the region will help Surge founders scale and build the transformational businesses of tomorrow,” said Sequoia in a statement.\n",
      "A Sri Lankan Tamil, Anandan will join the other six MDs at Sequoia Capital India, three of whom are based in India and three in Singapore. Sequoia is considered the top VC firm in the US, being an early investor in iconic companies like Apple, Google, WhatsApp, YouTube and PayPal. Its portfolio companies in India include hotels to co-living venture Oyo and food-delivery startup Zomato, besides top companies in Southeast Asia like Indonesian ride-hailing giant Go Jek and online travel firm Traveloka.\n",
      "His entry would also help the firm, which has raised $3.9 billion across six funds for the region, add firepower to its team as three of the MDs left to set up A91 Partners last year. VCs and entrepreneurs tracking the space said that the move underlines growing maturity for the startup ecosystem, where there are now experienced operators willing to take the plunge. Anandan’s move could set a precedent, they feel.\n",
      "“His passion and commitment for the early stage ecosystem as an angel investor par excellence and his unique ability to connect with founders will inspire them to think bigger, move faster and be different,” said Ravi Gururaj, president of TiE Bangalore, adding that Anandan brings unique ability to scale up digital and technology revenues from India customers to billion-dollar levels.\n",
      "A B.Sc in mechanical engineering from MIT with a masters from Stanford, Anandan started his career at McKinsey in the US where he spent over a decade and became partner on a fast track. He then moved to PC maker Dell where he served as executive assistant to founder Michael Dell and then moved to head the company’s business in India in 2006. In 2008, he joined Microsoft as India head and then moved to head Google operations as VP of India sales and operations. He was elevated to lead the Southeast Asia market as well in 2015.\n",

      "BUSINESS NEWS\n",
      "By Prabir Jha\n",
      "One of the ‘make-or-break’ factors for organisations in a hyper-competitive and complex environment is the quality of their executive team — their top leadership. Unfortunately, this always has remained a neglected area. Partly getting the right talent, internally or externally, is a legitimate challenge. But even more importantly, the unwillingness to bite some bullets is another commonly observed pattern. And without this agenda being addressed, a lot of the strategic thinking and doing could fall between the cracks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Get the best and keep the best: The war for the right executive talent is intense. People with the right skills and experience, combined with the appropriate softer skills of leadership, are not easy to find or attract. And yet, how do we ensure we follow the “two-pizza rule” for the size of the executive team and not make it an unwieldy exercise in appeasement? (According to the rule, generally attributed to Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, a team is too big if it cannot be fed with two pizzas). For boards and promoters, this must be an unending priority. The size, the mix, the constant struggle to look for and retain exemplary executive talent is a job not to be delegated or outsourced. Moreover, keeping top quality executives is never easy. They are not likely to be obedient and symbolic court poets. They will have a mind of their own and may even bruise a few egos, questioning some from the past. Whether individual ego will prevail over a larger organisational interest is a tough cookie to bite for many.\n",
      "Ensuring the right dynamics: For chief executives, this must be the toughest challenge to meet after getting the executive talent in. Not everyone is able to forge the right team culture at the top. Creating a shared destiny within the team, encouraging constructive differences, not encouraging dysfunctional behaviours and being ‘true and fair’ with your top team is a CEO’s nightmare. It needs extraordinary wisdom and courage to forge a team of amazingly talented individuals at the top. How many CEOs are rewarded or penalised for something as strategically crucial? Barely any.\n",

      "Performance & rewards dilemma: At this level, the stakes for rewards are high. Yet, collaboration to deliver a larger shared organisational goal is not axiomatic. Boards must ensure that overly individualistic rewards do not support integrative execution. There must be disproportionate share of the bonus purse for the executive team resting on shared goals. Or else you run the huge risk of siloed behaviour and independent satrapies, which do not support a sustainable organisation.\n",
      "The ‘Prima Donna’ effect: Even executive teams espousing a commitment to ‘collective responsibility’ run the risk of dealing with overly high-strung individuals. Much of the “I am special” syndrome typically flows either from a perceived higher importance of their agenda or function, a long tenure in the company, or personal political alignment with the promoter or the board. This is obviously dangerous and must not be encouraged. However, in many situations, the obvious advice is observed more in the breach than in the observance. The inability or the unwillingness to rein in such errant behaviour of such strong men (or women) will lead to some other top talent opting to quit the team. The loss then is only the organisation’s.\n",
      "Lack of inspiring role models: Many executive teams may have the requisite bouquet of functional leaders but lack inspiring role models. One of the biggest expectations of a top executive team is to inspire the larger company and beyond, attract and retain talent as also build a strong corporate brand. Not too many leaders at the top can claim to check these boxes off. In addition, a combination of functional experts is not a surrogate for an inspiring an executive team.\n",
      "Each person in an organisation — from the doorman to the chairman — will have a view on whether the executive team of the company is indeed thriving or just unwilling to vacate space. The question is how dispassionately do we firm up our view. Still more crucially, how expeditiously do we make our decisions and interventions. The margin for error is barely there.

      "CITY NEWS\n",
      "NEW DELHI: Aam Aadmi Party government on Tuesday filed an appeal before a bigger bench of the Delhi high court against a single judge order permitting private unaided schools in the city to hike fee.\n",
      "Directorate of education (DoE) has argued that schools are duty-bound to seek prior consent from it before any increase in fee, opposing the recent court decision allowing private unaided schools to go ahead with an interim hike in fee to implement the recommendations of the 7th Central Pay Commission on salaries of teachers and other employees.\n",
      "\n",
      "In its plea, DoE has also questioned some of the findings of the single judge, claiming that several issues that have been decided were not even raised, such as land allotment liabilities. The appeal is likely to be heard on Wednesday.\n",
      "The single judge on March 15 had permitted the interim fee hike by quashing a Delhi government circular of April 13 last year, which had prohibited private unaided schools functioning on government land from hiking tuition amount without approval from DoE.\n",

      "HC, while setting aside the circular, had said the statements of fee submitted by private schools will be subject to scrutiny by DoE “with a view to ensuring that the schools were not indulging in commercialisation of education by resorting to profiteering, or charging of capitation fee.”\n",
      "“The interim fee hike will operate immediately, in favour of all private unaided schools, without the requirement of any prior approval,” the court had said in its 173-page judgment allowing the plea of Action Committee Unaided Recognised Private Schools, which had challenged the circular.\n",
      "The court had also made it clear that “if any school is, in fact, found to be indulging in commercialisation of education, DoE will be well within its rights in proceeding, against such institution, in accordance with law, and keeping in mind the provisions of Delhi Schools Education Act and Rules”.\n",
      "The Action Committee, in its plea, had contended that Delhi Schools Education Act equalised all schools, in the matter of pay and allowances to be granted to teachers and employees and therefore, there was no justification to selectively withdraw the October 17, 2017 order which permitted an interim hike of fee to implement the 7th CPC recommendations.\n",
      "In its order, DoE had barred schools in the national capital from hiking fees with retrospective effect to implement the 7th Central Pay Commission’s (CPC) recommendations. The schools questioned the reversal of stand, arguing that earlier permission by DoE was “unreasonably withdrawn with retrospective effect” by the April 13, 2018 circular and it showed the Delhi government was delaying implementation of the 7th pay commission’s recommendations in private unaided recognised schools for paying increased salaries and allowances to their teachers and other staff members.\n",

      "NEW DELHI: It is an ambitious plan that seeks to expand Delhi University to six new campuses in Maurice Nagar, Dhaka, Karkardooma, Najafgarh and Bawana, and add three new hostels and a building of the Faculty of Management Studies in South Campus. But describing the construction rates quoted in the Rs 4,700-crore plan as “inflated”, the Union human resource development ministry has junked the expansion and advised the university to seek funding through Higher Education Funding Agency (HEFA).\n",
      "\n",
      "At a meeting of DU’s finance committee in February, the MHRD nominee, who is also a financial advisor in the ministry, objected to the rates quoted by the university’s Building Committee for the construction. Documents on four projects presented at the meeting, copies of which are with TOI, quoted Rs 70,000 per square metre as the construction cost, with the rate for the extension of Central Institute of Education being Rs 76,327 per sqm.\n",
      "A source present at the meeting reported that the HRD nominee said the correct rate should be in the range of Rs 35,000-45,000 per sqm. “Even in north-east Delhi, where the cost of construction is higher, it is around Rs 45,000 per sqm,” the official said, according to the source.\n",

      "For his part, DU vice-chancellor Yogesh Tyagi confirmed that the estimates were being re-examined. “These are major projects being planned after a long time in the university and will benefit a large number of students,” said Tyagi. The university authorities added that after the estimates are vetted, a fresh proposal would be put before the finance committee before getting the final approval at the Executive Council.\n",
      "In a letter to DU before the February meeting, MHRD had stated that there would be no new grants-in-aid for infrastructure development. The letter said that all central universities had been instructed to undertake major infrastructure projects through HEFA and not through grants-in-aid from MHRD or the University Grants Commission.\n",
      "This is the first major development plan in three years, but the finance panel sources said the incumbent administration erred by not consulting CPWD when preparing the project estimates. As another committee member pointed out, “The MHRD nominee cited the figure of Rs 4.2 crore for constructing a reading room and wondered whether the university was planning a reading room or a five-star set-up.”\n",
      "V K Agrawal, member of the finance committee, however, said DU should demand funds for building the new campuses and hostels instead of going via HEFA. He also asked the vice-chancellor to have the construction rates re-examined.\n",

The initiative was started by Professor Conor Walsh in collaboration with Professor Donal Holland and is funded by Tata Trusts through The Lakshmi Mittal and Family South Asia Institute, Harvard University.\n",
      "Goel, 22, explained, “The goal is to educate students in cutting-edge soft robotics research through hands-on learning. Our toolkit team develops low-cost kits that can be used in underprivileged classrooms in India.” Overseeing the workshop was R P Singh, Goel’s teacher at RPVV, Yamuna Vihar, and now the principal of RPVV, Dwarka.\n",

      "“Having studied in a government school, I understand there are constraints of exposure,” Goel said on why it was important for government schools to have this sort of experience. “When I went to IIT-Delhi, I found people straight out of school comfortably handling materials, unlike me.”\n",
      "RPVV, Dwarka, was one of the two schools chosen for the workshop, the other being Shiv Nadar School, Noida. Vikas Kumar, Shakya’s classmate, would not stop playing with the silicon in the toolkit and exulted, “I am doing all this for the first time.” And Shakya already saw how his creation could be used: “One can attach the soft robotic claw to a drone for lifting light things.”\n",
      "Singh was excited to see the curiosity of his students. “They so quickly understood how to make these things. They will never forget it,” he said. And as a participant of Monday’s workshop ran in to ask him for permission to take the claw to show his friends in his colony, the principal smiled broadly, “This is how education should be imparted, with students getting hands-on learning.”\n",
      "Science teacher Kusum Nagpal is thinking of how to give more students the same experience. “Apart from the silicon, other kit items can be replicated. Maybe we can try with clay,” she said optimistically.\n",

      "KOLKATA: Doctors at a city hospital extracted an 11.6-inch long gall bladder from a 61-year-old woman. The surgery was done through laparoscopic procedure. Tapati Bhowmik was suffering from an acute stomach ache on the right side of her upper abdomen region.\n",
      "\n",
      "Having conducted an ultrasonography on the woman, the doctors at AMRI Hospitals, Mukundapur, detected a sizeable obstruction in her gallbladder. However, the 11.6-inch gall bladder is a few inches short of beating the world record. The longest gall bladder was measured 11.8 inches and found in Suman Rao (46), a woman from Churu, Rajasthan in August, 2016. Doctors at Sawai Man Singh Hospital in Jaipur had removed the gall bladder, which was acknowledged by the Guinness Book as the longest gallbladder.\n",
      "In Kolkata, Sanjoy Mandal, senior GI, laparoscopic and onco surgeon, who conducted the surgery on Bhowmik, decided to conduct a CT scan and found that the gall bladder had extended much beyond its normal size to almost 12 inches, as opposed to the natural length of three to five inches.\n",

      "The diameter of the gallbladder, which is normally around four millimetres, had also expanded significantly. Mandal extracted the gall bladder along with two gall stones, each almost 3cm in diameter, from the patient through the laparoscopic procedure by stretching two of the holes made in her stomach.\n",
      "“Even though gall bladder surgeries are common, this case was particularly critical since one of the stones was putting pressure on the bile duct, causing further discomfort to the patient and making further complications, especially due to her pre-existing medical conditions. The patient suffers from pre-existing conditions like COPD, hypothyroidism and diabetes mellitus,” Mandal added.\n",

      "The 7,784-hectare Ridge “is under constant threat of encroachment. Since there are only three rangers, 15 deputy range officers and 77 guards for entire Delhi, additional manpower is required for active patrolling of Ridge areas”, the board observed. The guards will be deployed on a daily basis and paid minimum wages.\n",
      "Vimlendu Jha, a board member, told TOI that it was agreed that the Ridge needed better protection. Steps will be taken to map the Ridge areas and appoint four project associates. “The current staff did not have the requisite equipment or vehicles to go around. Besides getting more cars and bikes, tractors for plantation and project associates for Ridge demarcation will be hired,” said Jha.\n",
      "The total cost will be around Rs 19 crore. “The board had unused funds worth nearly Rs 200 crore. We are now looking to use it to protect the Ridge better and improve its habitat,” he added.\n",
      "National Green Tribunal (NGT) recently rapped the revenue and forest departments for delaying the process of demarcating Delhi Ridge. According to board officials, the south deputy conservator of forests has been asked to prepare maps of the entire Ridge boundary to clearly show the boundary walls and encroachments. “The chief secretary desired that a separate meeting of RMB be called exclusively to discuss the status/progress report on the demarcation of Southern Ridge,” the documents stated.\n",
      "The board had last year allotted nearly Rs 12 crore for a project in Central Ridge, which involved beautification, nature trails and removal of vilayati kikar in a 10ha area. The project, which is to be executed by Centre for Environmental Management of Degraded Ecosystems (CEMDE), is, however, yet to start.\n",

This will help make them aware of the different ways in which disability figures and operates in a literary narrative.”\n",

      "Vashi said they would consider going to the Supreme Court after studying the HC order.\n",
      "In 2014, the police cleared her three friends, recommended closure of the case as “false” and sought Sheetal’s prosecution. Referring to the case records and statements of 22 witnesses, the HC said: “This gist gives the entire picture how the duplicate paintings were prepared and replaced and the original paintings were kept under the command of Sheetal Mafatlal. Thus, it ex facie discloses that she has thorough knowledge of what she was doing and where the original paintings are and yet she has registered a false FIR...”\n",
      "Sheetal challenged the magistrate’s order of May 2015 before sessions judge R G Wankhade, who in September that year set aside the prosecution part of the order, but upheld closure of the theft case. The state government challenged the order in 2016, calling it “erroneous and illegal”. Valibhoy also moved the HC.\n",

      "UDUPI: Less than 24 hours after his escape from their custody, Udupi district police arrested Hanumantha Basappa Kamballi, an accused in the Manipal minor’s rape and murder case on Monday.\n",
      "The 39-year-old gave police the slip while he was taken to the district jail in Hiriyadka around 7.30pm on Sunday. He had allegedly kidnapped, raped and murdered a 17-year-old girl at Moodusagri of Shivalli village in Udupi district on March 9. He was booked under IPC sections 376 A, 366 A and 302, and section 6 of Pocso Act.\n",
      "Besides forming a special team, Udupi police sought public help to nab the accused. Accordingly, some residents told the police that the accused had fled wearing a blue T-shirt put up for drying near a quarry in Kajaraguthu on Sunday. The team managed to trace Hanumantha near Lanjoli bus stop in Pernankila at 6.45pm.\n",
      "Hanumantha, a native of Badami taluk in Bagalkot district, had allegedly lured the girl with a promise of getting her a well-paying job. However, he allegedly took her to an isolated place and committed the crime. According to investigation, the accused strangled the girl using her dupatta when she screamed and threatened to inform police and her family about the incident.\n",

      "Umesh Isalkar / TNN / Apr 3, 2019, 04:18 IST\n",
      "PUNE NEWS\n",
      "Pune: At 105, Balwant Ghatpande, among the world’s oldest physicians, has a life lesson to share __ keep it simple. He uses only basic drugs and mixtures for relieving many aches and pains.\n",
      "An age-old ‘turpentine liniment’ – a liquid preparation for body aches, a gooey pinkish-red syrup ‘linctus’ for easing cough and boric acid, an anti-fungal cure-all of sorts are the constants in his pharmacy. A basic antibiotic like oxytetracycline is his choice of drug for treating bacterial infections.\n",
      "“I dispense these drugs to my patients from my pharmacy as per their need. I avoid giving stronger antibiotics and I don’t write prescriptions,” he said.\n",
      "When it comes to diagnoses, Ghatpande relies more on clinic assessment. “I use a stethoscope, check the pulse rate and make use of my palms to sense the patient’s body type. This triad forms the core of my clinical diagnosis,” he said.\n",
      "Kashinath Vitekar, 75, a resident of Kasba Peth, is among his many loyal patients.\n",
      "“He never asks for lab reports. A few doses of capsules, tablets and a liquid mixture he gives always do the trick. I have never ever visited another doctor in my life,” Vitekar said.\n",
      "Jayant Salunkhe, who lives in Dhayari, comes all the way to Ghatpande’s clinic in Raviwar Peth for treatment. “Be it any seasonal ailment, we get relief in just two days,” Salunkhe said.\n",
      "His consultation charges are Rs 30. \"His fee has remained the same for many years. For medicines, he charges you additionally,\" Salunkhe said.\n",
      "Like his medical work, his way of living is equally simple and uncomplicated. “I eat food that it is easy to cook and digest,” he said.\n",
      "His advises a diet that is twice a day or small portions throughout the day. “I will suggest twice a day. But I think more than that it is important to have a very clear understanding of one’s digestion capacity. I never overeat,” he said.\n",
      "His daily regimen includes an hour-long session of physical exercises. “I never miss that. I do sit-ups, practise some drills on the lezim (wooden sticks with jingling cymbals attached to it),” he said.\n",
      "Is there any other secret formula he follows to keep fit? “There is no secret formula. You have to make your own formula and follow it religiously. Whatever I do, my principle is keep it simple,” he said, adding, “I work all the days of the week and never indulge in too much rest.”\n",
      "Ghatpande’s eldest daughter is seventy-eight years old. “She is a psychiatrist and lives a retired life in US,” his aide Mangesh Darje shared.\n",
      "Both his sons are doctors. Swanand is 74 and Sudhir, the younger son, died last year at the age of 69 following illness. His wife died four years ago when she was 92.\n",
      "Darje oversees his food preparations at home. “He never eats any outside food. Whatever he eats has to be home cooked. He likes spices in his food,” Darje said\n",
      "“He drinks buttermilk made from curd set at home with lunch. Another constant in his food is green chilly chutney with coriander. He likes to have poha soaked in milk or curd. He never eats curd or buttermilk in the evening,” he said.\n",
      "Ghatpande is a voracious reader. “He reads six newspapers at different times throughout the day,” Darje said.\n",
      "Born on March 15, 1915, Ghatpande received his four-and-half-year-old medical degree during British rule in 1941.\n",
      "“For every six months of the course, I would pay the fees of Rs 90 to my alma mater, B J Medical School,” he said.\n",
      "In 1946, B J Medical School was upgraded to B J Medical College. Ghatpande is perhaps among the few living doctors with Licentiate in Medicine and Surgery (LMS) which he received in 1941.\n",
      "The medical degree was replaced with Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS) at Bhore Committee's recommendations in 1946.\n",
      "On the root cause of rising cases of assaults on doctors, he said, “Dialogue with the patient is important. Doctors these days are overburdened so they find little time to strike up a conversation with patients,” he said.\n",

      "Kevin Mendonsa / TNN / Apr 3, 2019, 04:18 IST\n",
      "MANGALURU NEWS\n",
      "Mangaluru: As part of the ‘Year of Youth-2019’ initiative, churches under the Diocese of Mangalore are roping in youth to create awareness on voting and elections within and outside the community.\n",
      "This is the first that the church has been inviting youngsters to be part of the poll process, who have so far been aloof from the important process of elections. According to church leaders, the youth have been roped in at a time when the Vatican celebrates, ‘Year of Youth-2019’. Apart from it, church leaders along with priests have been holding meetings at the church and ward levels to convince its parishioners to come in large number to exercise their franchise on the day of voting.\n",
      "“Though Christians vote, their percentage in voting is less than other communities. Most of our votes are not cast, since thousands of the members of our community reside abroad, and many of those who reside here don’t turn up to vote. As a result, we decided to give youngsters the opportunity to create awareness on voting as a part of the ‘Year of Youth-2019’ initiative. The youth were given the opportunity to help people who failed to obtain their voter IDs. This includes first-time voters as well.

      "A youth said they have been actively involved in encouraging community members to vote, and to help them get voter ID cards. “As youth, we feel proud to work as volunteers and create awareness among the community as well as those from outside the community on elections and the importance of voting. Our aim is to ensure that a maximum number of people vote,” said a youth.\n",
      "Awareness is being created and meetings have been organised at the parish level, asking people to vote for the candidate of their choice. Most Rev Peter Paul Saldanha, bishop, Diocese of Mangalore, said that a circular has been sent to all churches, asking members of the community to vote without fail. He has asked people to vote for those candidates who protect democracy and secularism. “Apart from youth and the Catholic Sabha, a group of laity also have been involved in creating awareness on elections and voting,” added Paul Saldanha.\n",

      "NAGPUR NEWS\n",
      "Nagpur: Graduate doctors aspiring to pursue post graduate courses in medicine from the Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) on Tuesday protested the state government’s decision to implement new reservation quotas, leaving very limited seats for general or open category meritorious students.\n",
      "MBBS doctors who have cleared PG-NEET claimed their careers are in serious peril due to the new reservations for Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (SEBC — popularly known as Maratha reservation), and Economically Weaker Sections (EWS) in PG seats. They have sought an appointment with chief minister Devendra Fadnavis to discuss the possible solutions to this issue and their future prospects.\n",
      "“Only 233 seats are available for 2,054 MBBS doctors from open category who have qualified for PG admissions. Even if we add 37 seats in private medical colleges, only 270 seats are available for general category students. This type of implementation will be the end of meritorious students in Maharashtra,” said Dr Sameer Deshmukh, a resident at GMC.\n",
      "The seat matrix declared by the CET Cell says 3,913 candidates have qualified for PG admissions in Maharashtra for 1,441 PG seats. Out of these, 2,024 candidates belong to open category. For them, 233 seats are available in all state-run GMCs. These seats can be claimed by reserved candidates as well.\n",
      "Condition in private medical colleges is even worse. As 16% of SEBC cannot be implemented in management and NRI quota of private colleges, the government has added this number to the state quota, which has increased SEBC quota to nearly 30%, eventually leaving only 37 seats for general category students in private medical colleges.\n",
      "Dr TP Lahane, Director of Medical Education and Research, Maharashtra state, said general category students should go for seats of management quota in private medical colleges.\n",
      "“It’s a fact that only 37 seats are available for general category students in private colleges. We had no option but to implement the reservation as the high court has directed the same. However, we have deliberately kept the management quota and NRI quota out of any reservation. All 215 seats are available for general category students,” he said.\n",
      "However, fees in management and NRI quota is three to five times higher than the state quota seats, so this suggestion has left the protesting students angry.\n",

      "He was in Dakshina Kannada to campaign for Congress Lok Sabha candidate Mithun M Rai. Addressing the media, he attacked the Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led government and said that the government is threatening whoever raises their voice against it through IT raids, controlling the media and using blackmailing tactics. “So this Modi raj is mafia raj,” he said.\n",

Importantly, senior Congress leader Janardhana Poojary himself has blessed our candidate and the party. It is the biggest blessing for the party,” he said. “Nalin Kumar Kateel, who was elected twice on a BJP ticket, has turned out to be the biggest failure. He has not taken up any development works despite his party being in power at the Centre. Kateel has made a name only for setting fire to the district, but not for development works,” Dinesh said.\n",

      "On the Congress manifesto which was released on Tuesday, Dinesh said that the party speaks about inclusiveness, which assures of being beyond caste and religion. “It wishes to give a healing touch to the people of India, who have been devastated after demonetisation and GST. It has assured of giving 33 per cent reservation for women in Parliament as well as in the job sector. We have also promised 9 per cent of GDP to be set aside and spent on education and health,” he said. “Modi is a marketing genius and speaks only lies.

      "MANGALURU NEWS\n",
      "Mangaluru: An increase in political awareness among the masses, in addition to the model code of conduct stretching to almost two months, has resulted in a drastic slowdown of the real estate industry in Mangaluru.\n",
      "D B Mehta, president, Confederation of Real Estate Developers’ Associations of India (CREDAI), Mangaluru, told TOI, that on the policy side there are certain issues which led to this. “Revision of zonal regulation that was on the cards has been deferred by two months. Both Mangaluru Urban Development Authority (Muda) and Mangaluru City Corporation (MCC) are run by administrators. With the deputy commissioner busy with election duty, decisions are being delayed in both these bodies. The government decided not to make property cards mandatory till May 15, but there is a delay in the issue of property cards along with software issues.” he said. “We are expecting a limbo from May 15 till May 23, as no registrations can take place without property cards. If for 10-15 days, properties are not registered, especially apartments built and sold, the problems faced by the industry will only worsen. On property cards, CREDAI will seek an extension from the deputy commissioner, after the polling date of April 18,” said Mehta.\n",
      "Explaining issues on the business front, he said, “Home buyers are adapting to a wait and watch policy and want the formation of a stable government, irrespective of the party. Stability is important for economic growth and development. Enquires for commercial and residential properties have dropped by 75 per cent, indicating that people are politically aware of issues, and economic decisions are now being made based on the political outcome that is expected. This trend was unseen and unheard of, even during the last Lok Sabha or assembly polls,” said Mehta, attributing this trend to the social media.\n",
      "While many clients have put investments on hold, Mehta feels it would be ideal for the nation to go for polls in just three phases, and complete the entire process in 15-20 days. “The economy is getting affected. Once bookings reduce, the flow of funds gets affected, thus having an impact on execution,” he said.\n",
      "“Real estate slowdown has been recorded across the country since March, as the government brought down the GST rates, which is being implemented from April 1. People have thus postponed investments on purchase of homes,” he said. “Even at the national level, there is a slowdown visible in the collection of income tax in the month of March 2019 compared to March 2018, and the government is looking at a revenue shortfall of almost Rs 1 lakh core,” Mehta explained.\n",

      "MANGALURU: When Bank of Baroda (BoB) became the second-largest public sector bank in the country on the strength of ‘Power of 3’ on Monday, the employees — both former and the existing ones of Vijaya Bank (one of the merged entities) — were steeped in nostalgia.\n",
      "The first day of the current fiscal saw Vijaya Bank and Dena Bank get amalgamated with BoB as part of the first-ever three-way consolidation of banks after SBI subsumed its five subsidiaries.\n",
      "For Ravindranath Uchil, who superannuated from the rolls of Vijaya Bank in 2012 after 38 years of service, it was a moment to take a trip down memory lane. Having joined the bank in 1974, Ravindranath told TOI that the bank reached its heydays two years later under the stewardship of then CMD Mulki Sunder Ram Shetty. “It was a golden year in the bank’s history. It excelled in terms of percentage of business and profits,” he said.\n",
      "It was also the year when the bank opened highest number of branches to spread the vision of its founding fathers: to help the agrarian population in this part of the state. A resident of Manjeshwar, Ravindranath was posted to Ernakulam. “I was posted there as I know Malayalam,” he said, adding most of his batchmates were posted to north India. “Our chairman never posted anyone in their home location,” Ravindranath added.\n",
      "The only employees who escaped this were women and widows who were given posting at branches closer home. “His (Sunder Ram Shetty’s) only words while handing out the employment letter, which he personally did, was to tell employees to do their best and live up to the aspirations of the founding fathers,” Ravindranath said, adding this worked.\n",
      "Such was their sense of dedication that employees on rolls of Vijaya Bank turned down lucrative job offers from elsewhere. Ravindranath recalled that Kochi Refineries offered him a job at Qatar on better terms. “It was the love for Vijaya Bank and the trust that Sunder Ram Shetty had reposed in us that saw most of us reject such offers,” he said, adding he would still go around proudly claiming to be a former employee of Vijaya Bank.\n",

      "PUNE NEWS\n",
      "Pune: After nearly one and a half decades, one of India’s indigenous breeds, the Marwari horses, raced on the tracks of the Pune Race Course earlier this month.\n",
      "The horses with their unique inward turning ears and wideset eyes once again exhibited that they can hit and own the tracks in their own right.\n",
      "The efforts of the Indigenous Horse Owners Association (IHOA) have ensured that the Marwari horses, once again, get the opportunity to show their grit.\n",
      "The races were part of the fourth edition of the Marwari Horse Show organized in the city. The association continues to strive to meet its target of having a platform for these smaller horses to display their calibre.\n",
      "Marwari horse breeder and member of IHOA, Harsh Lunia, said, “We want to see 400 metre, 600 metre and 800 metre races at the Race Courses meant for Marwari horses. We want races built around these horses capability so that the calibre of these indigenous horses can be proved.”\n",
      "President of the association, Ajay Nensee said, “Issues pertaining to medical protocol had led to discontinuation of the Marwari horses in the Gymkhana Races. However, there is once again an opportunity for these horses. Racing is at an all-time low due to the introduction of Goods and Services Tax as 40 % of the stables at Royal Western India Turf Club (RWITC) are empty. If one race is organised per weekend for Marwari horses, wherein all medical protocols are followed and with the same trainers that breed thoroughbreds, the breed will get the much needed boost. We are set to initiate dialogue with the RWITC.”\n",
      "According to Nensee, thoroughbred horses are bred and trained for speed. “The fastest running stallion and mare are bred for perfect results. However, that is not the case for Marwari horses. In many parts of the country, horses are pride animals and bought only with that intention. We want to change this mindset regarding Marwari horses and are thus promoting their use in sports. These horses are now participating in endurance races. The level of showing of these horses has also been taken to another level with electronic judging for a logical and fair system. When the horse becomes an athlete, the purpose of breeding of the Marwari horses will change,” he explained.\n",
      "In the first edition of the Marwari Horse Show, there were about 60 to 70 entries. “This year, we had about 135 entries. There is no strong data to prove so but the number of Marwari horses is constantly growing. We have about 100 members now from across Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Gujarat and even the Southern states. The horses have now been accepted by the Equestrian Federation of India and are competing,” Lunia added.\n",
      "Lunia said they have not defined a good blood line stock when it comes to Marwari horses. The breed specifications aren’t in place either. In case of thoroughbreds, one can know the blood line and the price. They are an organised industry, he said.\n",
      "Meanwhile, Nensee said, “We do not have enough veterinarian support as there are not many who specialize in equine. In Maharashtra, there are three to four good quality doctors but they are not available on time or for follow-ups. Several vets have showed interest in training camps, but one-day training is insufficient. There is a need for good quality breeding stations and a full-fledged breeding programme.”\n",
      "Equine trainer and horse breaker, Rasika Reddy, said thoroughbreds are a product of breeding between four Arab stallions and English mares. What came from the breeding was a fine breed which was fast. Due to this, people began racing with these horses. One needs to look back to seven generations of the horse to establish that it is a thoroughbred.\n",
      "To get Marwari horses to race adds another dimension to the breed. While these horses do get to perform in areas of Gujarat and Rajasthan, it is mainly a cultural affair. However, if these horses can demonstrate that they can race, it would be amazing, she added.\n",

      "Pune: It was a chilly morning in February and Mitali Khaladkarr was yearning for tea to soothe her sore throat. “There are not many options near my home in Kasba Peth, and I was too tired to make tea for myself,” she says.\n",
      "On a whim, she started browsing through her food ordering app when she found what she was looking for --- piping hot tea delivered straight home.\n",
      "Half expecting how it would turn out to be, Khaladkarr ordered a special chai from Adhya Amrutulya in Raviwar Peth on the food ordering platform. “The delivery was swift and I was happy that l could finally have tea. Moreover, it was the best tea I have had in years,” she recalls.\n",
      "But little did she know that the tea she had was from one of the oldest tea joints in the city until one of her friends told her so. “I thought it was from one of those fancy tea shops that had come up in the vicinity,” she says.\n",
      "Set up on July 27, 1924, Adhya Amrutulya has moved with the times to reach out to tea lovers in the city. “When we started our business, the population of Pune was around 15,000. Now it is nearly 50 lakh. The city has grown so much that not everybody can come to us, so we decided to reach out to our customers,” says owner Rahul Nartekar, a fourth generation entrepreneur.\n",
      "“In fact, we are one of the first tea joints in the city to deliver tea on food delivery platforms such as Zomato, Food Panda and Swiggy. We typically cater to customers within a range of 3-5 km as the packaging we use keeps the tea warm for around 20 minutes. We receive maximum orders online between Friday and Sunday, mostly from Bhandarkar Road, Prabhat Road, Nal Stop, East Street, Swargate, Shivaji Nagar and Kasba Peth,” he says.\n",
      "But Nartekar insists that they have only tweaked their business model but haven't really changed with the times. “Our taste has remained the same over the years. The tea is still prepared by hand and is made hundreds of times a day. We don't prepare tea for more than 15 to 20 cups at a time. So, every time you have tea at our shop, it tastes fresh.\"\n",
      "In fact, they continue to make the same types of tea and coffee which were popular in the 1920s and 1930s. “We make black tea, sada tea, special tea, fakkad chai (boiled in milk) as well as black coffee, sada coffee and special coffee. Our tea used to cost ek anna in 1924, though the minimum price of tea is now Rs15. While special tea costs Rs 25, fakkad costs Rs 30. Our special tea, which is made using different types of masalas, is very popular among our customers,” says Nartekar.\n",
      "Though the shop used to earlier sell various types of sweets such as rasgulla and pedhe, they have been discontinued with. Currently, it sells misal pav, wada pav, adraki poha and upma. “My great grandfather Vishwanath Nartekar introduced the food items after his tea business took off,” says Nartekar.\n",
      "Interestingly, tea wasn’t the first business of Nartekars. “We used to have bhang ka gota here, but after having bhang people generally need tea. So my great grandfather thought of opening a tea shop here so that people can have bhang and tea at the same place. He made up his mind to make tea in such a way that it would be amrutulya, akin to nectar,” he says.\n",
      "The shop used to be frequented by many freedom fighters. “Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru had tea from our shop,” says Nartekar. In fact, the shop has been popular with singers, film stars and politicians too.\n",
      "“There is a recording studio -- Melody Makers -- diagonally opposite to our shop where singers like Lata Mangeshkar, Mohammed Rafi, Kishore Kumar and Asha Bhosale would record. It was a ritual for them to have tea from our shop before any recording,” notes Nartekar.\n",
      "“Our shop has been a favourite haunt of politicians too like Sharad Pawar, Balasaheb Thackeray, Patangrao Kadam, Suresh Kalmadi, Girish Bapat and others.”\n",
      "Adhya Amrutulya sells more than 3,000 cups of tea every day. “We have maximum customers between 6am and 10 am and between 4pm and 7pm. We serve tea in a special kulhar to keep it warm. Food is served on a plate and bowl made of single wood. We have kept the look and feel as it was in then. For us, it is no longer a business but an effort to keep a tradition alive,” stresses Nartekar.\n",
      "For the last nice decades, the Nartekars have been sourcing tea dust from Kerala. “We buy a special variety of golden tea dust from there. All the masalas that we use to make tea are also sourced from there. We make several trips to Kerala every year to source the right quality of tea,” he points out.\n",
      "Now, Nartekar wants to come up with packaged tea under the brand name Adhya Amrutulya. “It will hit the market next year. It will be available in tetra packs too. We will come up with different varieties -- black tea, green tea, lemon tea etc. To deliver tea on food delivery platforms, we are working on a different type of packaging to keep the beverage warm for around 30 minutes,” he says.\n",
      "Nartekar is hardly bothered about the mushrooming of amrutulyas in the city. “We are not in any competition with anybody. There are two types of tea drinkers – those who drink tea because it is tea time and then there are those who are lovers of tea. We have lovers of tea coming to our shop for generations,” he says.\n",

      "Nagpur: Eleven years after her death, the district consumer disputes redressal forum imposed a cost of Rs13 lakh on Sadar-based Shanti Mohan Hospital and three doctors for alleged medical negligence which took the life of a BTech woman in 2007.\n",
      "According to her family, Payal Mishra (in her 20s) was admitted to the hospital following complaints of stomach pain and swelling on June 9, 2007. But the hospital allegedly administered her anti-TB drugs leading to deterioration in her health. The doctors denied the allegations saying “she was never diagnosed or treated for TB at the hospital”.\n",
      "The deceased’s father, Suresh Mishra, a resident of Central Avenue, moved the forum citing deficiency in service leading to medical negligence on June 6, 2008. Mishra held Shanti Mohan Hospital, its proprietor Dr Sanjay Jain, medical officer Dr YR Jain and visiting consultant Dr Y Balsubramanyam responsible for Payal’s death.\n",
      "In its final order passed on March 15, the forum ordered all the four respondents to pay (individually or collectively) Rs2.70 lakh with 10% interest towards medical expenses from June 5, 2008, the date of filing complaint, a cost of Rs10 lakh in damages and Rs30,000 for legal expenses to Mishra.\n",
      "In his petition, Payal’s father alleged that the three doctors admitted her claiming she was suffering from tuberculosis and started the treatment on June 9, 2007. Investigations proved she was not a TB patient. Meanwhile, her condition deteriorated forcing the family to shift Payal to Care Hospital on June 14. Care doctors told the family Payal was suffering from cardiac encephalopathy disorder which led to her death on June 24 while undergoing treatment in ICU.\n",
      "Accusing Shanti Mohan Hospital and the three doctors of deficiency in service, Mishra complained that despite spending lakhs of rupees, his daughter couldn’t saved. He demanded Rs15 lakh in compensation stating that Payal was a brilliant student and well-placed in a private firm earning a handsome salary.\n",
      "The respondents denied all the charges levelled against them on the basis that Payal was never treated or diagnosed for TB under their care at the hospital.\n",
      "Talking to TOI, Dr Sanjay Jain said he had never examined Payal. His name was dragged in the case solely because he owned the hospital, Jain said.\n",
      "Dr Balsubramnyam, who had referred Payal to Shanti Mohan Hospital, had examined her at his clinic on Central Avenue in the afternoon the day she was admitted. “We never treated her for TB as claimed in the petition. She had come with abdominal pain and complained of irregular cycles,” he said.\n",
      "Dr Balsubramnyam said Payal had left the hospital on foot after discharge against medical advice. “As per our investigation, she was suffering from anaemia and had water had filled near her heart,” he said.\n",
      "Rejecting the doctors arguments, the forum pointed out that as per her death certificate, it is evident that the patient passed away due to cardiac arrest. “But in the papers provided by Shanti Mohan Hospital, there is no mention of cardiac problem. If proper treatment for heart problems was done, her condition may not have worsened,” it said, holding the respondents guilty for her untimely death.\n",

Though the SHG movement in India started in 1980, it strengthened during the late CM NTR’s tenure in the state.\n",

      "“Around 80% of the SHGs are under the eligible category of taking loans Rs 3 lakh which is now approaching towards Rs 5 lakh loan eligibility. That means all these groups are active.

      "“We gave money in the very first year for the new capital city, but not a single permanent structure has come up there. Claims are being made that the central government is not giving money for the new city. The few temporary structures in Amaravati have been built at a cost of Rs 10,000 per sq ft,” Goyal claimed, adding that he was asking the AP government to give an account of the money given by the Centre “because nobody will believe that a temporary structure will cost Rs 10,000 per sq ft”.\n",
      "“I challenge Naidu to a debate on all these issues. I have invited him to Delhi on a date and time of his choice because Telugu people all over India and all over the world want to know the truth. I will expose all the falsehoods that he has sought to project in the debate,” he said. He further alleged that Naidu was running the government like a “private family firm”, and people will wind up this firm on April 11 (election day). “This government is focused on the welfare of one family. I am told there are four candidates from that (Naidu’s) family fighting in this election,” he said.\n",

Murthi, who died in a road accident in the United States in October last year, had served two times as LS member, the first time being in 1991-96.\n",

Purandeswari had also been a junior minister in the Manmohan Singh cabinet. The projects include making the city airport into an international destination, the merger of the ailing Bharat Heavy Plate and Vessels with BHEL, and the introduction of a Vistadome train between the city and Araku, a tourist attraction.\n",

      "JAIPUR: The mines department has banned the transportation of mineral felspar in the form of grains, chips and gitti out of the state up to October 2021. Felspar is a major raw material used in the production of ceramic tiles. The department took the decision on the recommendations of the industry department to protect the domestic industry.\n",
      "According to sources there were about 3,500 mining quarries of felspar in the state. These quarries mainly cater to the ceramic units located in Gujarat.\n",
      "At present, the grains, chips and gitti mined in Rajasthan are transported to Gujarat in its raw form and is processed into powder there before being supplied for industrial use.\n",
      "This has affected about 3,000 domestic industries set up in the state and a large number of workforce engaged in this sector. Sources said the ban on the transport of felspar in raw form would help the domestic industries which could add value addition by processing it into powder and supply it to the industries directly.\n",
      "This would not only generate additional revenue to the government in the form of GST besides generating more jobs to the youth and help the domestic industry to flourish, sources said.\n",
      "Sources said the state government in October last year had restricted the transportation of felspar which had to a certain extent, helped the domestic industry. But it was only a partial move, it could not generate the desired effect.\n",
      "So, the government has decided for a total ban. So now, with the ban, felspar can be exported only in the form of powder, which would be a boon for the industrial units in this sector, sources said.\n",

      "Srikanta Tripathy / TNN / Updated: Apr 3, 2019, 11:18 IST\n",
      "JAIPUR NEWS\n",
      "JAIPUR: Land allotments by RIICO to industry continues to decline, precipitating a prolonged slowdown in new industrial investments that is going from bad to worse over the last three years. The situation in the past three months is no different even as a new government in the state has come to power, dashing hopes of new jobs creation.\n",
      "In the 11 months of the current financial year through February, RIICO’s land allotment came down to 106 acres from a recent high of 2,276 acre in 2016-17 and 152 acre in 2017-18.\n",
      "Worse, the state public sector utility has not been able to acquire any land during the current year against a target of 900 acre. Similarly, it has also missed targets for developing land in its possession. It had planned to develop industrial areas of 2373 acre in the current year but till February, it has developed only 1153 acre.\n",
      "TOI tried to reach top RIICO officials to understand the reasons behind the state PSU’s failure to meet its own targets for successive years but could not get a response. However, the business community in the state said that investors are not very keen to come to Rajasthan because of high land prices and bureaucratic hurdles.\n",
      "“First, the land rates in neighbouring states Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh are lower than in Rajasthan. Even as the desert state has large parcels of infertile or semi fertile land, the government has raised their prices so high that the investors find no business case to buy land and set up industry here. Secondly, the bureaucracy and the system is a challenge that very few investors want to navigate,” said an industrialist preferring anonymity.\n",
      "After the Congress government took over in December last year, the thrust has been on framing the industrial policy. RIICO had sent its officials to various states to study industrial policies and practices so that the best of the features can be incorporated.\n",
      "But another industrialist said that the high prices of land is such an obvious factor impeding investment that it does not need deliberations lasting for months. “The quicker they take a decision, the better will be the situation,” he said.\n",

      "Divya’s 2432 Elo rating also makes her No. 5 in the junior (U-20) category. She is the only Indian in the top 10 of this list. The achievement places her at No. 3 among Indian women. Ahead of her are the more experienced 31-year-old Humpy (2549 Elo) and 28-year-old Harika Dronavalli (2492 Elo).\n",
      "“I had not expected both to happen so fast. I just hope I can maintain the rating and also go on to become No.1 as soon as possible. This isn’t the limit for me,” Divya told TOI.\n",
      "Divya’s rise in the rating is very fast and she has done “pretty well in the last three months”, according to Humpy. “This is a very good sign for the country. After me, I think Divya is the only women player to have achieved this feat,” she told TOI.\n",
      "A two-time world cadet chess champion, Divya became city’s first Women International Master (WIM) in 2018 and started the year with an Elo of 2168. In three months, she garnered 264 international rating points.\n",
      "Following her maiden triumph in the open women category at the AICF International Round Robin tournament, Divya scored her first IM norm too. At the Aeroflot Open 2019, she missed the IM norm but cleared her second WGM norm and also touched a live rating of 2,400.\n",
      "Divya’s consistent performance recently helped her go past senior Indian players like Soumya Swaminathan (2402), Tania Sachdev (2397), Eesha Karavade (2370), Padmini Rout (2364), R Vaishali (2353), Bhakti Kulkarni (2350) and Vijayalakshmi Subbaraman (2342) among others.\n",
      "In October 2001, a 14-year-old Humpy had cleared the 2,400 mark to become the youngest Indian player ever to do so. Within a year she also became World’s youngest GM beating Judit Polgar's previous mark by three months. Humpy’s record was broken by Chinese Hou Yifan in 2008.\n",
      "“It is a sign of fast improvement and her learning is in the right direction,” said Humpy of Divya touching the 2400 Elo mark.\n",
      "“Crossing 2400 is very good as it also helps in getting the IM title. Otherwise, crossing the rating becomes more difficult than clearing norms,” said Divya.\n",
      "While Divya broke Humpy’s record of achieving the 2400 Elo mark by some months, the 13-year-old has in her all the ingredients of becoming India’s youngest GM too. Humpy, however, has a word of caution for Divya. “Divya’s tough fight starts from here as her opponents will be more alert. She needs to work a lot to maintain the rating and should only think on how to improve further,” she said.\n",
      "“I think maintaining the rating can be little tough and increasing it will be really difficult now. My initial aim is to become an IM and then as usual the GM title. But improving my game is my priority,” said Divya.\n",

      "Chandigarh: After getting Congress ticket from Chandigarh Lok Sabha seat, TOI caught up with former union railways minister Pawan Kumar Bansal, who was hopeful that people will prefer Congress over BJP this time. Excerpts from the conversation:\n",
      "Your first reaction after getting Congress ticket?\n",
      "I thank the party leadership for reposing confidence in me. I will try to come up to their expectations taking everybody along in the party here. There were all sorts of speculations in the media and amongst people that I won’t get the ticket this time and that usually does happen. But it gave me no sleepless nights. For the last two months, I haven’t been to Delhi. I was confident somehow because of my work here and my connect with the people of the city, the party would repose that confidence in me.\n",
      "How will you take along rival factions like that of Tewari and Sidhu group?\n",
      "Firstly, I would like to rebut again as I did in the past. There is no rival group in Chandigarh Congress. All true congressmen in the city supported me. As far as Manish Tewari and Dr Navjot Sidhu is concerned, I suppose the final list of Punjab is not out yet. They are trying their best to win seats in Punjab. But I would seek support from all congressmen and Congress leaders from Punjab and Haryana including Manish Tewari and Dr Navjot Sidhu.\n",
      "How will you woo the voters this time?\n",
      "The failure of BJP has given the chance to the residents to compare the work done by me and sitting BJP MP in Chandigarh. People can compare work done under the UPA government and BJP government. The BJP government failed both at local and national level. The promises were made to residents but never fulfilled by the BJP.\n",
      "Any message for your likely opponents in BJP.\n",
      "It’s only after the candidate selected by BJP, I would comment on it. But I would endeavour to set good and high standards of political discourse in the city. That would be my sincere endeavour.\n",
      "Who do you think will be easy candidate in BJP for you to defeat?\n",
      "This is something which is not within my command and reach. I never gave it a thought. I will decide the next course of action only after BJP decides its candidate. Given the BJP, whether it is A, B, C or anyone, they all belong to BJP. They will all be responsible of acts of omission and commission, and that baggage everybody will have to carry. I think people will prefer Congress this time.\n",
      "Your opponents are planning to raise the Rail Gate scam. How will you tackle opponent's strategy?\n",
      "If anyone who raises the Rail Gate scam, it will be either out of total ignorance, or out of total malice and mischief which I don’t think my opponents in BJP are. It is defamatory and I have proceeded against some people, I would see what appropriate action I have to take. I have not only got a clean chit but I am cited as prosecution witness in the case. The court had even dismissed an application moved by an NGO seeking re-investigation into the case, saying that the application is devoid of merits. The BJP leaders, who will raise this point, are masters in spreading misinformation.\n",

      "BHOPAL NEWS\n",
      "BHOPAL: Three entrepreneurs from Bhopal have made it to the Forbes 30 under 30 list for Asia. Umang Shridhar and Abhishek Dubey have been named on the list for their start-ups while the publisher trio of Piyush Ghosh, Tannison Mathews and Tuhin Sen were listed for ‘The Optimist Citizen’.\n",
      "Shridhar, founder of KhaDiGi a fabric supplier, is working for the welfare of artisans of Bundelkand by providing them congenial working atmosphere with better machinery and access to market. “This is a big achievement for me. Being from a village background, I saw the hardships of people and realized that their talent was not being recognised. When I graduated, I wanted to do something for them to improve their conditions,” she said.\n",
      "Founder of Muskaan Dreams, Dubey is trying to improve the level of education in government schools so that children coming from a humble background can also get good education like those studying in private schools.\n",
      "“I grew up in a village of Madhya Pradesh and saw for myself that the state of government schools was pathetic. So, I wish to ensure that the coming generation does not have to go through what I experienced. I started designing techniques to digitalize classrooms in government schools for children from humble backgrounds, which led to the birth of my company,” he said.\n",
      "The journal 'The Optimist Citizen’, which was co-founded by Ghosh and his friends Tuhin Sen and Tannison Matthews, highlighted positive development in the society. The journal aims to change the mindset of people by bringing them positive news from around the world.\n",
      "Know these entrepreneurs\n",
      "Umang Shridhar - Coming from the nondescript Kishunganj, a small village in the Bundelkhand, Shridhar wanted to do something for the underpaid artisans of the region. After completing BCom (Honours) from Delhi University, she realized the need for a business-to-business model to improve the condition of the artisans and recognize their talents. KhaDiGi, a fabric supplier platform, was founded in 2017, after a lot of ground research. The firm started as a means to empower women by teaching them how to weave and spin ‘khadi’ cloth and then expanded to give a platform and market to the local artisans.\n",
      "“I had seen that the working conditions and wages for the local weavers, artisans, dyers, spinners was very poor. After completing my graduation, I enrolled in NIFT to study textile designing. I spent two more years researching about the needs and problems of artisans and then developed a B2B model to make and sell fabric to big textile companies. The model is made taking into account the needs of the local artisans, and not for the sake of profit alone,” she said.\n",
      "Abhishek Dubey - Hailing from Gwalior, the co-founder of Muskaan Dreams, which works to improve the infrastructure and digitalize government schools, is working to ensure that children studying in government schools also get the same facilities that private school children get. “I used to notice that government schools did not have proper infrastructure or teachers. And even if the students wanted to study, they did not have the resources,” said Dubey.\n",
      "Dubey completed his Bachelors in Engineering and started working to teach kids in a shelter home. Muskaan Dreams was born in 2014 as an organization promoting education for the underprivileged. It later grew into a start-up to equip government schools with e-learning tools, digital infrastructure and provide training to teachers to operate the gadgets.\n",
      "So far, the organization has digitalized 100 classrooms in seven schools of Gwalior, Indore and Bhopal, reaching more than 12,000 children and improving attendance and enrollment in government schools.\n",
      "The Optimist Citizen - Co-founded by Piyush Ghosh, Tuhin Sen and Tannison Matthews of Bhopal, The Optimist Citizen is a monthly journal that brings positive news and developments to the readers. Established in late 2014, the monthly journal aims to change people's mindset by giving them something good to look forward to.\n",
      "“My friends and I are avid readers and we read the newspaper daily. While we were in college, we used to be frustrated reading about murders, rapes and all kinds of scams in daily newspapers. It was then that we thought that people who are working to create change in society must also be given due credit and attention, which seemed lacking in the news back then. So the three of us started it as a volunteer project while we were in college and kept it alive even after we graduated,” said Ghosh.\n",
      "The four-and-half-year-old journal is touching lives and slowly weeding out the negativity that creeps in due to negative news.\n",

      "Sandeep Moudgal / TNN / Updated: Apr 3, 2019, 08:24 IST\n",
      "-\n",
      "BENGALURU: The latent dissidence within the state Congress and the discontent among some leaders over the coalition with JD(S) have led to a proxy war between the party’s principal troubleshooter, DK Shivakumar, and the Jarkiholi brothers in Ballari. It was only four months ago that Shivakumar had helped his party wrest control of this Lok Sabha segment from the BJP.\n",
      "The bad blood began last year when Shivakumar entered Belagavi politics by backing Laxmi Hebbalkar in the Belagavi Rural assembly constituency and her camp in the elections to a local co-operative bank. The Jarkiholi brothers from the Valmiki community — Ramesh, Satish, Balachandra, Lakhan and Bhimshi — have long regarded Belagavi as their exclusive political turf. Even though Ramesh and Satish are Congress members, the clan viewed Hebbalkar’s growing profile as a strategy by Shivakumar to gain a foothold in the region.\n",
      "The coalition politics drama at this stage made matters worse as the Congress refused to offer cabinet berths to Satish and Ramesh, forcing the ouster of the eldest brother, and Shivakumar gained the upper hand in the Belagavi turf war.\n",
      "The fallout is now visible in Ballari where a candidate with family ties to the Jarkiholis, Y Devendrappa, has entered the fray on a BJP ticket, challenging VS Ugrappa who is backed by Shivakumar. Devendrappa’s son is married to Jarkiholis’ sister.\n",
      "The Ballari segment is reserved for the Scheduled Tribes. Shivakumar had helped the Congress win this segment in the November 2018 bypolls after 14 years, and he is currently the district in-charge minister for Ballari.\n",
      "Shivakumar’s push in Belagavi has strained the Jarkiholi family’s links with the Congress. Ramesh, a sitting Congress MLA, has reportedly moved closer to the BJP, boosting the saffron party’s apparent efforts to topple the Congress-JD(S) government. Balachandra is already a member of the BJP.\n",
      "Before fielding Devendrappa, the BJP leadership faced a dilemma in Ballari as the Reddy brothers and Valmiki strongman B Sreeramulu stepped aside. The party wanted Sreeramulu or his sister, J Shantha, an MP in 2009, to contest here, but they were not enthusiastic about the move after the BJP lost the bypoll to Congress by over 2 lakh votes. Moreover, Sreeramulu shifted his focus to Chitradurga. The Reddy brothers are staying away from the Lok Sabha campaign to sort out their legal troubles arising from allegations of illegal mining.\n",
      "All this gave the Jarkiholi family an opportunity to launch a counterattack, through the BJP, in Shivakumar’s new territory, according to some political observers.\n",
      "Shivakumar denied there was a proxy war and said relations alone cannot work in elections. “In politics, everyone is related to someone. I too have relations cutting across party lines, but that doesn’t guarantee a win. I don’t want to take anyone’s name or consider it a proxy war,” he said.\n",
      "Congress working president and Bidar candidate B Eshwar Khandre hopes Ramesh won’t hurt the party’s chances in Ballari. “I’m still hoping Ramesh Jarkiholi is a Congressman,” he said.\n",

      "On Tuesday, party president Pandurang ‘Deepak’ Dhavalikar told TOI that by April 8, MGP would take a call on which candidates it would support in the parliamentary elections as well as in the Mandrem and Mapusa bypolls. Political observers said the the state’s oldest regional outfit is likely to back independent candidate Jit Arolkar in Mandrem and Congress candidate Sudhir Kandolkar in Mapusa, which will result in BJP having to put in extra effort to wrest control.\n",
      "Former deputy chief minister Ramkrishna ‘Sudin’ Dhavalikar told reporters that MGP had decided to pull out of the parliamentary polls after it realised that it would not be able to reach out to voters in all 40 constituencies. “That’s the reason former MLA Naresh Sawal and I advised the central committee against contesting the Lok Sabha elections,” he said.\n",
      "He, however, exuded confidence that the regional party would win the Shiroda seat by a huge margin.\n",
      "Responding to queries on merger prospects, the former PWD minister said, “MGP will never merge with any national political party and I am not authorised to merge the party. I will never merge MGP, even till my last breath.”\n",
      "Sudin also reacted to BJP state president Vinay Tendulkar’s recent statement denying that BJP had split MGP. “While speaking to reporters, Tendulkar had said that BJP had been busy preparing the relevant documents for the split, which is why it had failed to inform MGP’s senior functionaries about the development. It is clear who has split MGP,” the former deputy chief minister said.\n",

      "NEW DELHI: Congress on Tuesday promised full statehood to Puducherry but stopped short of making a similar commitment for Delhi if elected to power, evoking a sharp reaction from AAP.\n",
      "Reiterating the current power structure in the national capital where the lieutenant governor acts on the advice of the elected government on all issues except land, police and public order, Congress said in the manifesto that it will amend the Government of NCT of Delhi Act, 1991, to remove ambiguities. This was under the ‘Federalism and Centre-State relations’ section of the manifesto.\n",
      "\n",
      "The party, however, said that it will give full statehood to Puducherry, a small Union territory on the southern coast which is also a half-state with a legislative assembly similar to Delhi.\n",
      "The Congress dispensation in Puducherry finds itself stuck in a situation similar to Delhi and has been at loggerheads with the lieutenant governor there, accusing him of not allowing the elected government to function. In Delhi, the AAP government has often expressed its frustration of its proposals and schemes being vetoed by the Centre or put on the back-burner as the national capital lacks the status of the full-fledged state. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has also said that the elected government does not even have the power to hire a peon.\n",
      "While the Congress has promised to amend the law of 1991, a constitutional bench of the Supreme Court had in its July 2018 order laid down a similar provision. The AAP government has been sending the files of new proposals and schemes to the LG after implementing them on the ground. The LG, however, continues to enjoy the undiluted power and control over Delhi Police, matters related to public order and land.\n",
      "Though former chief minister Sheila Dikshit has often said that she had enjoyed a cordial relationship with the Centre during her three terms, the manifesto gives enough indication that the Congress government in Delhi too had confrontations with the LG and clarity on the power structure was important for smooth Centre-state relations.\n",
      "The issue of giving Delhi the status of a full-fledged state has made it to Congress manifestos in the past, but despite appointing committees to examine the proposal, it could not move ahead on it. While Dikshit did not comment on the issue on Tuesday, she had earlier told TOI that during the Congress rule of 15 years in Delhi, she had tried for full statehood but could not achieve it. In an interaction last week, Dikshit had clearly said that the issue of full statehood was irrelevant in the coming General Election and the party won’t include it in the manifesto.\n",
      "The Congress has also promised to prevail upon the states to implement the 73rd and 74th constitutional amendments, which talk about devolution of funds and functions upon municipalities directly from the Centre. This will strengthen the municipalities vis-à-vis the state governments and will also give them the power to do planning, which is currently enjoyed in Delhi by Delhi Development Authority.\n",

      "-\n",
      "NEW DELHI: A tense confrontation was seen on Twitter on Tuesday between two AAP MLAs after Congress released its manifesto without including full statehood for Delhi in it.\n",
      "The argument reached such an extent that Greater Kailash MLA Saurabh Bharadwaj dared Chandni Chowk legislator Alka Lamba to join Congress. In response, Lamba hit back saying: “Why are you impatient. Some people have already gone. Some will not go so easily.” She was indirectly referring to several AAP leaders who have quit the party over the years.\n",
      "The sparring began when Lamba wondered on Twitter how AAP and Congress would form an alliance when the latter hadn’t included the former’s main poll plank in its manifesto. “Every party has its own election manifesto. Congress manifesto promises full statehood to Puducherry but it is silent on Delhi. This makes it clear that full statehood for Delhi is not an issue for Congress. AAP is making statehood its main issue. How will an alliance be formed?” Lamba posted.\n",
      "Her comment invited a sharp reaction from Bharadwaj, who quoting Lamba’s tweet stated on Twitter: “What do you want? Full statehood or ……”\n",
      "Unable to digest this, Lamba reverted: “How does what I want make a difference… anyway the time to ask this question is over… now the people of Delhi will decide.”\n",
      "However, the exchange of words didn’t stop at that. Bharadwaj replied: “The public should know what their leader wants, only then the public will take a decision about their leader.”\n",
      "At this, Lamba reverted: “My public knows me well. In 2020 (when Delhi assembly election will take place) I will inform the public of my five years works and my thoughts. Secondly, my thoughts are contrary to yours. More than the public, a leader should know the thoughts and wishes of the public. The leader should not impose (themselves) on the public.”\n",
      "Bharadwaj then asked what people in Lamba’s constituency wanted. “The public wants education, health, water, electricity, pollution-free Delhi, corruption-free system, security and respect. With all these they also want their leader to stand with them in moments of happiness and sorrow. They want that their leader does not make a promise which he cannot keep. The public has already been cheated, they do not want more betrayal,” she responded.\n",
      "The remarks were seen in indirect reference to Lamba’s recent remark that “there is no internal democracy in AAP.”\n",
      "Adding fuel to the fire, Bharadwaj also shared a video in which Lamba was seen slamming Congress and BJP over full statehood. Lamba pointed out that the AAP leadership didn’t consult people before deciding to seek an alliance with Congress. This prompted Bharadwaj to ask when is she going to ask people whether she should join Congress or not.\n",
      "Lamba then announced that at 3pm on Wednesday at Jama Masjid she will ask people whether she should join Congress or not. Bharadwaj then told Lamba not to back out and said he will also participate in the meeting.\n",

      "TNN / Apr 3, 2019, 04:45 IST\n",
      "GOA NEWS\n",
      "Margao: Madgaonkars kept their tryst with their patron deity Lord Damodar, or Dambab as he is reverentially known, as they flocked to Zambaulim, 25km from the state’s commercial capital to celebrate the annual gulal. It’s their ardent belief that Dambab plays gulal with Madgaonkars on this auspicious day.\n",
      "It was a riot of colours amid a sea of revelers as “Zambaulecho Gulal” got under way. Cries of ‘Shree Ramnath Damodar Maharaj ki Jai!’ and ‘Har Har Mahadev’ rent the air as devotees flung fistfuls of gulal at the ‘palkhi’ carrying the idol of Lord Damodar stationed in the courtyard of Shree Ramnath Devasthan. Within seconds a cloud of red enveloped the landscape.\n",
      "History has it that the original temple of Lord Damodar was located in the area known as ‘Madd’ in Margao, which is now referred to as Lingakadden and where the ancient temple tank still stands. During the time of the early conquests by the Portuguese in the 16th century, locals attempted to shift the Shivling to a safer place, but only managed to sever a part of it which they shifted to Zambaulim where the current temple of Shree Damodar stands. It’s in gratitude to Shree Ramnath that Dambab’s palkhi is brought to the temple the night before gulal.\n",
      "The week-long Shishirotsav at Zambaulim began with the arrival of the traditional nal’l (holy coconut) from the house of late Purushottam Keni in Comba, Margao, to Damodar temple, Zambaulim, in a procession, on Thursday. Dhulpeth is celebrated the day after gulal, which is famous for the sumptuous meals served to devotees. The shigmotsav culminates with the immersion of the nal’l into the river.\n",

      "Deepak Karthik / TNN / Apr 3, 2019, 04:45 IST\n",
      "TRICHY NEWS\n",
      "Trichy: In any game, when the captain is not playing, the vice-captain takes charge. But when the vice-captain fails miserably, fans would wish that the game was better not played. The scenario was no different when the ‘vice-captain’ of Desiya Murpokku Dravida Kazhagam (DMDK) Vijaya Prabakaran tried to don the jersey of his father and DMDK founder Vijayakanth, fondly addressed as Captain, at an election campaign at Trichy on Tuesday. Except for the party flags installed in the venue and blaring songs praising the DMDK founder, there was no similarity between the campaigns of DMDK’s captain and vice-captain.\n",
      "Vijayakanth had two innings as a politician, the one before 2016 which was illustrious and established him as an aggressive politician who took on the two Dravidian giants. The other innings he played post-2016 saw him mostly babbling with funny reactions which lent themselves to meme-making material. His son Vijaya Prabakaran, a 28-year-old architect and owner of Badminton sports club, displayed no shades of either of his father’s innings. Vijaya Prabakaran arrived at the venue late by which time DMDK’s Trichy LS candidate was ‘missing’ and his cadres seemed restless. “Had it been Captain, the candidate would have stayed put even if it took hours for him to reach,” a DMDK sympathiser said concealing his disappointment.\n",
      "“We cannot expect him to speak and connect with us like his father. If not for his father, he would have been nowhere near the position he enjoys. Premalatha Vijayakanth articulates well with her extempore speech,” T Parthasarathy, a resident of Palakkarai said while passing time at Eda Street. Out of the 30 minutes halting time of DMDK’s campaign vehicle, his elder son spoke for hardly 8 minutes while the candidate, Dr V Elangovan, and tourism minister Vellamandi N Natarajan accounted for the rest of the time. Forgetting the leaders of his own party, a major portion of the AIADMK minister’s speech was devoted to praising Narendra Modi\n",
      "The vice-captain’s speech was neither aggressive nor enthusiastic with the listeners engaged in their own individual pursuits. “He looks similar to his father when he was young. His speech will improve over a period of time,” said S Kumar, a DMDK cadre from Gandhi Market. At one point, tourism minister Vellamandi N Natarajan who was standing along with Vijaya Prabakaran signalled the cadres to clap when the vice-captain was unsuccessfully trying to be sarcastic. Suffice it to say that the DMDK vice-captain, who is reckoned as the fourth star speaker of DMDK after his maternal uncle L K Sudheesh, failed to do justice to the importance the party bestows on him and did not emotionally bond with the cadres as Captain does.\n",

In addition to that, we will also solve the mystery behind the death of former chief minister and punish those who were behind it. There are a lot of difference between us and AIADMK, especially Jayalalithaa, but it is the chief minister who died.”\n",

      "TRICHY NEWS\n",
      "Trichy: It is rare for the performance of local bodies to have a say in a Lok Sabha election, but this time around, there is anger in panchayats situated close to urban local bodies against the manner in which the state’s political apparatus failed to hold elections to local bodies since 2016. Though the elections were deferred citing litigation and administrative reasons, residents say they have been paying a heavy price as their demands for basic amenities have been left unaddressed.\n",
      "The recent public dissent shown against AIADMK MLA and minister S Valarmathi while campaigning at Sevanthiyanipatti hamlet near Srirangam on March 29 was the outcome of this utter neglect, residents said. Poor focus and delayed solutions for a myriad civic issues including potable water supply and motorable roads have been making life difficult for a section of rural residents. Unlike in the urban local bodies, villagers say the absence of elected councils had robbed panchayats of funds and workforce to get works done. For instance, residents of panchayats situated close to the Trichy corporation limits badly miss their councillors and presidents who used to take their demands to the local body.\n",
      "“Even for a minor grievance like a blockage in drinking water pipeline, panchayat officials take days to rectify. The lapses in ensuring basic amenities are being blamed on the state government which will contribute to the anti-incumbency,” R Kathan, a retired health inspector from Kumbakudi panchayat near Trichy said. While the ruling dispensation would bear the direct impact of this anti-incumbency feeling among villagers, the opposition too may not benefit much as people feel that its representatives had been maintaining silence on the issue of holding civic elections.\n",
      "The elected representatives in rural local bodies acted as a bridge between residents and the authorities but with MLAs refusing to take up the responsibilities, these people have been left in the lurch. The special officer appointed by the state government has to cover about 20 village panchayats and hence expressed their inability to fulfil their demands. “People are loathing us every time they raise a complaint. They don’t understand our constraints and are upset with our services,” an official source in panchayats department said.\n",

      "NAGPUR NEWS\n",
      "Nagpur: Creating awareness and acceptance of autism in society is crucial as one per cent population of the world today is born autistic and one lakh children are added to the figure every year, said Dr Yashwant Patil, international president of Commonwealth Association for Health and Disability (Comahad) on Tuesday.\n",
      "Talking to TOI on the sidelines of a programme organized by Comahad, Prayas School for Children with Special Needs and South Central Zone Cultural Centre on World Autism Awareness Day, Patil said, “I believe we have come a long way in creating awareness, but there is still a lot more to do.\n",
      "There is a big chunk of society which still needs to be educated, from social workers to teachers to even paediatricians. People need to know that autism is not mental retardness, it’s a behavioural disorder that affects social skills,” he said.\n",
      "Patil spoke about how early detection can help manage autism to a great extent. “Autistic children show early signs from the age of 6-9 months. If paediatricians are able to detect the signs within 30 months, there are interdisciplinary therapies through which autism can be managed,” said Patil.\n",
      "Earlier, ‘Walk for autism’ rally was taken out from Sarvoday Ashram, Amravati Road. Over 120 students, parents and a few doctors participated in the rally with the aim of spreading awareness on the issues circling autism.\n",
      "Later in the evening, specially abled students of Prayas School performed various acts and put up a fashion show in a cultural evening held at SCZCC. Director of SCZCC Deepak Khirwadkar was the chief guest while senior paediatrician and executive director of Comahad Dr Uday Bodhankar and school president Kiran Dive were present.\n",
      "Speaking about the aim behind the international day, Dr Bodhankar said, “We are only asking for inclusiveness from society. Schools today can accommodate autistic children and teachers and staff can give a little extra guidance. Only awareness on such issues can make the society more accepting.”\n",

Mathura DM told TOI that he had asked an SDM to probe into allegations.\n",
      "Hema, who was touring her constituency on Tuesday, arrived in Ajhai Khurd village at around 11:30 am and addressed the meeting in the school premises where crowds had gathered in advance. People of the village say that for the entertainment of the crowd, organizers had roped in dance performers, whose moves were vulgar.\n",
      "Talking to reporters, principal of the school, Sarla Devi Sharma, said that the public meeting was organised without permission from the authorities. “When we came to school in the morning, a tent had been pitched there and public gathered. It was like occupying the school forcefully,” Sharma said, adding that when she raised the issue, she was told that there would not be any trouble to the school and students.\n",
      "Sharma said that she had to close her school after the mid-day meals as there was no point of teaching students while such loud music was being played nearby. She said the organisers had told her that the meeting would finish in two hours. She also claimed that she had to intervene to stop the “obscene” dance performances. “With young children (6-14 years) studying in the school, the dance performance was absolutely undesirable”.\n",

      "Volunteers and party workers mill around the place sporting caps and scarves bearing the colours and symbol of the party. A group of workers who belong to NCP, a Congress alliance partner, are also chipping in. Patole had contested last election from Bhandara-Gondia constituency on a BJP ticket but later resigned and quit the party.\n",

To plan the campaign. Eighteen block presidents and 38 booth level presidents and heads of various committees meet at our office everyday,” Thakre adds. “The entire local Congress machinery is behind our candidate,” he adds.\n",

      "Door-to-door contact programmes, street corner meetings and rallies are organized for Patole every day. Women volunteers who are not party workers are also present in the office expressing their willingness to campaign for the leader. “Patole has a clean image and people are connecting with him on their own. He has risen from the grassroots level and is fighting to get justice. This is a war between a commoner and an industrialist or dhan shakti versus jan shakti,” says Thakre. “Both Gadkari and Patole entered politics at the same time. Patole is still a simple grassroots level leader, but Gadkari’s growth as a businessman has been phenomenal,” says Surendra Solanki, a party worker who has come from Delhi.\n",

There are a lot of undercurrents and the poor and the business community, which were with Modi in the last election, are now returning to the Congress,” Thakre adds.\n",

      "Apr 3, 2019, 04:52 IST\n",
      "KOLHAPUR NEWS\n",
      "Kolhapur: NCP chief Sharad Pawar said on Tuesday that Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s attack on the Gandhi family was evidence of his hatred for the ideology the family represents. Pawar said Modi had violated the oath taken while being sworn in as the nation’s prime minister by his manner of ignoring groups that make for the diversity of India.\n",
      "Pawar was addressing workers of all parties of the Maha Aghadi led by Congress and NCP. At the Monday rally at Wardha, Modi criticised the Gandhi family and attacked Pawar alleging that his nephew is snatching away the party from his uncle.\n",
      "In a 40-minute speech, Pawar said, “I have seen and worked with many prime ministers. None of them has attacked chief ministers, even those belonging to other parties. Modi goes to West Bengal and criticises Mamata Banerjee, he goes to Hyderabad and Kerala and criticises chief ministers of those states. This does not suit the dignity of the office he holds. He criticises the Nehru and Gandhi family. He has forgotten the sacrifices of our freedom fighters and of Gandhi family members. I don’t know why he criticised me and my family. Ajit Pawar is a cultured person and a good administrator. We in the Pawar family offer some values while raising our young ones, and they are brought up to give back to society. The attack on Nehru or the Gandhi family is because of the ideology these represent, that Modi hates.”\n",
      "Pawar also offered an assurance to the prime minster, saying he had no cause for worry on account of the NCP. “The NCP is not a party of just one person. It is the party of workers and Modi should not worry about our party.”\n",
      "Pawar said Modi’s allegation that Congress demeaned Hindus was to be condemned. “Modi’s speech was all about Hindus. He has taken an oath delivered by the President of India that he will work for all sections of society. Are Muslims, Buddhists, Christians not part of India? Have they not sacrificed for India’s freedom? Modi thinks nothing of violating the oath taken on the Constitution. Such a person does not deserve to hold the office of prime minister,” Pawar said, appealing to workers to ensure that the alliance wins both seats, Kolhapur and Hatkanangale.\n",
      "Pawar reminded party workers that Raju Shetti, MP of Hatkanangale, quit the alliance with BJP after he found Modi’s policies anti-farmer. Shetti is now with the Maha Aghadi.\n",

      "JAIPUR NEWS\n",
      "JAIPUR: To revive conditions of cleanliness in the Pink City, Jaipur Municipal Corporation (JMC) has allotted beats to all the sanitation workers.\n",
      "The beats or areas of working, have been assigned after receiving many complaints from residents on irregular attendance of the workers. Under the new system, the workers will be held responsible for cleanliness of the assigned areas. Names and the contact details of the assigned workers will be provided to the local councillors, residents and will be put up on the website of the JMC.\n",
      "There are around 7,000 sanitation workers working in the city on monthly wages, but many complaints have been received from the residents that though the main roads of the colonies are cleaned properly, they usually ignore the inner lanes, especially in the Walled City.\n",
      "JMC commissioner, Vijay Pal Singh while talking to TOI said, “Through this system, every lane will become a worker’s liability and a complaint can be easily resolved by taking action against them. We want to regularize the procedure, as right now, there is no check upon them and the claim that they make. We have even introduced biometric attendance for the sanitation workers to keep track of the attendance.”\n",
      "Around all the claims made by the JMC officials about being vigilant about cleanliness, councillor of ward-90, Gyarsilal Saini had a verbal spat with the sanitation committee chairman Rajesh Biwal, as for the past nine days, garbage collection vehicles are not coming in his ward. He alleged that Rajesh Biwal asked for bribe in the name of ‘chai-paani’. “For the past nine days, I have been coming to JMC but the problem is not getting solved. On Tuesday, residents of my ward came to my house and dumped the garbage bags there.\n",
      "This has gone out of limit now. Chairman Biwal is busy taking bribe and people of my ward are suffering,” said Saini.\n",
      "However, chairman denied the allegations and said that he asked for ‘chai-paani’ in a friendly manner and the councillor took it otherwise. “Around 18 garbage-collecting vehicles of the firm, in the Amber zone were seized by the bank for non-payment of loans which created this situation. I have assigned 15 new garbage-collection vehicles on Tuesday and three tractors are also working in the zone for over a week. This is a false allegation and we are doing what we can under the situation,” said Rajesh Biwal.\n",

      "This is the first time Patil has stayed away during a visit to the city by Pawar. Patil is currently campaigning against NCP candidate Dhananjay Mahadik. Patil is also unhappy with NCP leadership for inducting his father and long-time Congressman DY Patil into the NCP. Patil reportedly considers this to be an attempt to create a rift between his father and himself.\n",
      "An aide of Patil, requesting anonymity, told TOI, “He was not in the city the whole day. We got the invitation to attend the meeting of workers of all the parties of Maha Aghadi. However we have taken the position not to cooperate with Mahadik. We are not against Pawar, we respect him. Our opposition is to the Mahadik family.”\n",
      "Since the last two days after Pawar’s Tuesday meeting was fixed, messages from Satej Patil’s camp thronged social media accounts of his supporters. The posts read that Patil and his supporters are not against Pawar, but they will continue to oppose Mahadik. Patil had recently told district NCP head AY Patil that he felt betrayed after he was defeated by Mahadik in the assembly election even after he supported Mahadik in the last Lok Sabha election.\n",
      "In the party workers meeting in the evening, district Congress president Prakash Awade said to Pawar that he was trying to carry out a ‘dressing’ on the wound caused by differences between Satej Patil and Mahadik.

      "“Inspections by the Medical Council of India (MCI) are scheduled in some medical colleges of the state. So the medical education department has transferred over 50 doctors from the SMS Medical College,” said a senior administration official from the college.\n",
      "Five new medical colleges have come up in the state at Dungarpur, Pali, Bharatpur, Churu and Bhilwara. The academic sessions in these medical colleges started from 2018-19. “Every year, the MCI visits the new medical colleges for inspections to monitor that they are following the norms. The MCI team checks the number of doctors available as required in norms for a medical college,” said a doctor of professor rank, who has been transferred.\n",
      "The medical education department is facing acute shortage of doctors for fulfilling the MCI norms across the state. Among the doctors who have been transferred include senior professors. These include specialists in medicine, pharmacology, biochemistry, radiology, orthopaedics and microbiology, among others.\n",
      "Four orthopaedic specialists have been transferred from the SMS hospital, Jaipur, to the Government Medical College, Kota. The medical education department has proposed to MCI to increase MBBS seats in the Kota Medical College from 150 to 250.

      "For Dungarpur Medical College, the medical education department has transferred 10 doctors from SMS Hospital. Four doctors have been transferred from Kota to Dungarpur.\n",

A doctor who provides treatment regularly to his patients understands their problems better.” The doctors who have been transferred are awaiting MCI inspection. They are hopeful that once the inspection is over, they will be called back to the places from where they were transferred.\n",

      "Serial 'bride' arrested; gang supplying girls for marriage busted in Bundelkhand\n",
      "TNN / Updated: Apr 3, 2019, 13:55 IST\n",
      "BHOPAL NEWS\n",
      "BHOPAL: In the backward Bundelkhand, where bride-buying still prevails, the police have arrested a thug-bride whose modus operandi was to run away with cash and jewellery after marriage. Sunil Gupta, a small-time trader of Chattarpur district was her third victim or husband, so to say.\n",
      "The woman -- known as Sapna -- was arrested after the police busted the gang which was supplying brides in Bundelkhand. The area is notorious for its skewed sex ratio.\n",
      "According to the police, Sunil Gupta, the trader from Kishangarh village of Chattarpur district, told Chandu, a local, about his desire to get married. Chandu and his accomplice Goloo -- both middlemen -- then introduced Sunil Gupta to Rahul, a resident of Sagar.\n",
      "Investigating officer of the case Virendra Paraste said that Rahul promised Sunil a bride, but said the cost involved would be Rs 1 lakh. “They made a deal for Rs 95,000. While Rahul and Sapna divided Rs 50,000 among themselves, Rs 45,000 was divided between the other two,” police said.\n",
      "Compared to the national sex ratio of 940 women per 1,000 men in the country, all districts of Bundelkhand in MP have sex ratio below the national average. Chhatarpur -- with an abysmally low sex ratio of 883 women to 1,000 men -- leads the lot. It is followed by Sagar (893), Tikamgarh (901) and Panna (914).\n",
      "As it is difficult to get brides in the region, gangs and middlemen are active there. The gangs bring girls from Odisha to Bundelkhand for marriage.\n",
      "“This has been going on for many years now,” the police said, adding, “many marriages last, but many people are cheated too.”\n",
      "So Rahul from Sagar, who pretended to be Sapna's brother, introduced her to Sunil Gupta. “She is my sister and we belong to Chhattisgarh,” he told Sunil.\n",
      "SHO of Kishangarh police station Paraste said, “The marriage was performed on March 4 and Rahul performed her kanyadaan. Rahul stayed with his ‘sister’ in her ‘sasural’ for a day on March 5. But on the morning of March 6 morning, they both went missing.”\n",
      "Along with them, gold and silver jewellery worth about Rs 3 lakh was also missing, the police said.\n",

      "NAGPUR NEWS\n",
      "NAGPUR: Coal India Limited (CIL) subsidiary in the city — Western Coalfields Limited (WCL) — posted an output of 53.18 million ton (MT) of coal for the fiscal 2018-19 which surpasses the target by 7 MT.\n",
      "The company could not only achieve but even surpass the production target after a gap of eight years. The company has also registered the highest ever year on year growth in production at 15%, said a press release.\n",
      "The company also dispatched 55.56 MT of coal to different consumers surpassing the target by 5.86 MT. This has led to an all time high growth of 14% in coal dispatch. The company hopes to improve its financials riding on the growth in production and dispatch, said the press release.\n",
      "WCL management has attributed the growth in production to the Mission 2.0 initiative launched by the company. This is an HR initiative in which various solutions for improving the company’s performance are considered through suggestions from different quarters.\n",
      "The production could also be increased as WCL opened 20 new mines in the last four years. The mines contributed 35.8 MT of coal production for the year 2018-19. Areas under the new mines also registered a 30% year on year growth in terms of production, said the press release.\n",

      "TNN / Apr 3, 2019, 04:58 IST\n",
      "KOCHI NEWS\n",
      "Palakkad: Demand to revive the Bharathapuzha railway station is gathering steam as five trains have decided to skip the Shoranur Junction station to avoid delay in changing engine.\n",
      "“If there is stoppage for trains at Bharathapuzha station, passengers can use road transport to reach Shoranur junction which is one kilometre away. Land has already been acquired to construct a road from Shoranur junction to Bharathapuzha station,” said Gandhi Seva Vedi general secretary Prasad Shoranur.\n",
      "However, officials of the Palakkad railway division said that since Bharathapuzha station was in the mainline, trains could not be operated from here. “That is why the railways closed down this station, and there is no scope for its revival now,” they said.\n",
      "Bharathapuzha and Mankara railway stations were closed down due to operational loss as there were no enough passengers to travel from these stations.\n",
      "The officials said that stops are provided for the five trains, which have skipped the Shoranur station, at Ottappalam and Vadakkancherry railway stations. Hence, passengers will not get affected.\n",
      "They said there should be 400 to 500 passengers originating from a station daily to provide a stop for long-distance trains. The five trains did not have this minimum number of passengers. These trains had skipped the station to avoid congestion in the Shoranur station. This will help operate more trains and also MEMU services from Shoranur.\n",
      "“There is demand for a Mangalore-Rameswaram and Ernakulam-Rameswaram train using the Palakkad-Pollachi new broad-gauge line though the Shoranur station,” the officials said.\n",
      "Meanwhile, there was a proposal for a triangular station or bulb station at Shoranur Junction to connect it with Bharathapuzha station to avoid delay in changing engines at Shoranur. The proposal was to connect the adjacent railway stations of Shoranur, Bharathapuzha and Vallathol Nagar to turn the direction of trains coming from Thiruvananthapuram and Mangaluru side to Shoranur. This would facilitate engine reversal without changing the direction of the train. But the proposal was rejected by the railways in 2005.\n",
      "Officials said that there was no proposal under the consideration of Southern Railways now to construct a triangular station or bulb station at Shoranur.\n",

There is also a belief that the festival is conducted to celebrate the killing of a demon by the goddess.\n",

      "The work of the thatched sheds (pandals) were completed along the route of the procession of caparisoned elephants in Nenmara town. Considering the high temperature and heat wave in Palakkad, steps are being taken to spray water en route and in the pandal vicinity, according to the Vela committee officials.\n",

    "Description=['Eighteen years have been kind to her; those who saw Isha Koppikar that many years ago in En Swasa Kaatre, opposite Arvind Swami, will recognise her in a jiffy even now. Tell her that, and she sasses back, “Nothing has changed here either. Same people, same city, same attitude… everything’s the same even now.” And this sets the tone for a then-and-now chat with her. Prompt with her answers, candid, with a healthy dose of self-praise thrown in, Isha tells why she stopped acting in Tamil films, why she’s, for the lack of a better word, making a ‘comeback’ with Sivakarthikeyan’s movie with Ravi Kumar as a femme fatale, and what she’s been up to in all these years…\\nA film with Sivakarthikeyan, no less!\\nThis project has been on for almost a year now. Last August, we had one schedule, then the January one this year got delayed and fell into February. We have one in September now.\\n\\nSo, a comeback?\\nI guess, yeah, you can call it that. Two years ago, I stepped into the south industry again with the Telugu movie Keshava, then did Looti in Kannada, I have another one lined up with Shivaraj sir… word got around and Ravi Kumar got in touch with me for this one, saying he has a role he wanted me to play. I played a cop in all of the movies mentioned above, but this one was full-on action, kind of Lara Croft-ish, and that got me interested.\\nA lot has changed in 18 years, has it?\\nNothing has changed — I don’t know whether this is good or bad. But there still are no heroine-centric roles down south, no experimentation, the same kind of stories. New-age cinema seems to have flown right over Tamil cinema. In Bollywood, we now have films that are with the times, like Gully Boy, there are small-budget films that have done exceedingly well — that Vicky Donor wave that brought in Shubh Mangal Saavdhan, Bareilly Ki Barfi, Badhaai Ho… almost all of Ayushmann Khurrana’s films should have made people down south think about upgrading the art of movie making, but no… we’re in love with stereotypes.\\n\\nThe stars?\\nOh, they too! They too! Arvind Swami is still around, Vijay is still at the top… when I focused back on south, I realised all my co-stars of 18 years ago are the one still rocking.\\n\\nThe going was good for you back then. Why did you leave?\\nI was studying. All of 15, just out of school, and I come from a family of doctors and educated people. So my dad said nothing doing. You must complete your graduation, or you are not stepping out of the house for anything. He said just in case your acting career doesn’t work out, you must have something to fall back upon. Well, that’s the system we live in, so I could hardly argue. So, I went on to complete BSc in Life Sciences. But between that, coming down south to do movies wasn’t possible. I kept modelling and doing music videos in Bombay, as I could juggle that because it was right there. The boarding, lodging, the distance meant I couldn’t juggle the schedules of Tamil films with that same ease. And when I turned 21, was done with studies and all, it was too late, I was well-settled in Mumbai.\\n\\nNow, you are a mom. And the industry, especially down south, isn’t known to be fascinated with that ilk…\\nYeah, I feel that; all the time. But not explicitly, not yet. I mean no one has said that to my face. Of course, Ramya Krishnan has done a great job with her career – she’s continued right through marriage and all. But when people here look at me, the first reaction is, ‘How have you maintained yourself so well?’ They’re surprised that I am still in shape despite marriage and childbirth. I tell them if you want to be in show business, you better look good!\\n\\nThey tell you you’re hot?\\nThat’s the common refrain. ‘My God, you still look awesome.’ It makes me feel great. All the carbs I have not eaten all these years is at last making me feel it was all worth it. But I am amazed how I have been welcomed here — with grace and aplomb.\\n\\nSo, what are you doing in this Sivakarthikeyan movie?\\nIt’s something not seen before here. We have not had the concept of a well-etched out ‘alien’ in Tamil cinema before this. Even in Bollywood, there was Jaadu in Koi... Mil Gaya, that’s it. And even that was more of prosthetics. But this film is all about CG. It’s almost as if two films are being made — one on computer and CG, and one that we are physically shooting.\\n\\nAny old friends? Favourite stars?\\nI meet old, and new ones, too. Favourite stars… Arvind Swami is my all-time favourite because I have worked with him. And I used to be quite fond of Ajith back then — I don’t know if he’s still around, though…\\n\\nAnd Sivakarthikeyan, your current co-star?\\nHe reminds me so much of a younger version of Rajini sir that sometimes I am taken aback.\\n\\nWhy? Does he emulate Rajinikanth?\\nNo, it’s not because of his mannerisms, or anything. I am not saying he’s consciously trying to emulate Rajini sir, but it’s there. Maybe the hair, the face, the look in the eye, the colour… Something.\\n\\nThere are so many Bollywood heroines trying to make a mark down south now. Will you find your niche?\\nBut there is no action heroine down south, yet. And I fit the bill — I play the femme fatale in this one, and I look like that. Even if I say so myself, I know that I am versatile. People look at my role in Shabri and say, oh, de-glam. But truth is I was made to look de-glam with heavy makeup because I know that I look good without any makeup, too. I used to spend hours scrubbing off all that during Shabri. I also love these kind of dancing and action roles, too. I am a black belt in Taekwondo, and I still practise twice a week, fitness is a passion with me, and that helps.\\n\\nAnd the language?\\nI am good with languages. I can grasp easily, plus, I used to chant Sanskrit mantras when I was young, and that helps with the pronunciation. I encourage all of them on the set to speak to me in Tamil.\\n\\nSo, when you have to emote in a strange language, or that chemistry with a co-star you’ve never heard of before, how does that happen?\\nThe emoting isn’t tough — happiness and sadness have no language. About the co-star, yea, I still don’t know anything about Sivakarthikeyan personally. But thankfully, there’s no love between us in the movie. I am the killing machine and all full of hatred! I look glam, and hot and am the femme fatale. So thankfully, no love and chemistry.\\n\\nHave you travelled much down south?\\nI’ve been to Tirupati, and the other day, on the way to the shooting spot, on OMR, I saw all these shoe stores so we zipped in there. I love food from Saravana Bhavan, and Krishna Sweets – I take their mysorepak for the whole city when I go back. (laughs)\\n\\n\\nWhat else — what have you been up to all these years?\\nI’m a full-time mother, now, have a hospitality business, production house, and am also into politics now, having joined the BJP.\\n\\n\\nWhy politics?\\nI believe we need a strong leader, strict rules and laws. We Indians work only under pressure. If we are told ‘if you don’t do this, you’ll be penalised’, we will do it. We need to be forced into compliance, and hence need strict ruling. Look at all our scriptures, for instance. Most of what’s in them are scientific, but how did they make us follow them? By putting the fear of God in us — ‘If you don’t do this, something bad will happen’…\\n\\n\\nBut there are so many stars out there as politicians…\\nI don’t care. I believe that because we are celebs, people tend to accept what we do or say sooner than they would an\\n\\naam aadmi. That’s why we endorse products. So why not endorse thoughts and ideologies? Why not help the helpless?',\n",
    " 'If you think children’s stories are mostly about chocolate factories and Cinderella, a new play is here to prove you wrong. City-based group Theatre Dots is opening a sequel to its well-received drama, Act or Not to Act, in the city this weekend. The new piece, titled Say No to Plays, is filled with scenes of laughter and a few awkward and serious moments. It scrutinises 15 reasons to make one think twice before auditioning for a play.\\n\\n“Primarily divided in two parts, the play features as many as 30 young artistes, who are constantly in pressure to meet the expectations of their parents while pursuing their dream in performing arts. Obsession and addiction are among the themes that are explored in the course of the play. Six monologues comprise the first half of the performance, while the second half dabbles in questions like what is more important — the depth or prominence of an actor in a scene, or how much he/she has actually enjoyed enacting it,” explains Pooja Singh, writer and director of the play.\\n\\n\\nLoosely based on an American play series, Say No to Plays “offers a glimpse into teenagers’ private thoughts”. The story aims at making one introspect about the amount of pressure that is mounted on kids. The 80-minute show also includes an original track, the lyrics of which are written by Pooja, and music is composed by two students. It is being staged at Rangasthala auditorium, Rangoli Metro Art Center on March 3.',\n",
    " 'When Yajamana, produced by Media House Studio, hits theatres today, fans of Challenging Star Darshan will have reason to rejoice, as it brings him back to the big screen after a year-and-a-half. The film, directed by V Harikrishna and P Kumar, pairs Darshan with Rashmika Mandanna and has actors like Tanya Hope, Devaraj, Dhananjaya, P Ravi Shankar and Thakur Anoop Singh, as part of its ensemble cast. Here, Darshan tells us what makes his film a must-watch.\\n\\n“For starters, I want to clarify that we have not set out to do anything extraordinary. Yajamana is a clean entertainer with the right amounts of action, comedy, romance and drama that will appeal to family audiences. Apart from the fact that it is my film, Yajamana has a strong story and message for society. Cinematographer Sreesha Kuduvalli’s visuals are a highlight and the two tones he has used in different parts of the film are noteworthy. The songs by Harikrishna are an added bonus. Most importantly, you will see a variation in my dialogue delivery,” says Darshan.',\n",
    " \"So you think the paper towel you have at home is just for wiping and cleaning? Heck, no! There are so many things you can do with them apart from the regular. Here are four genius hacks that will leave you impressed.\\nSmelly shoe deodorizer\\n\\nSpread the paper towel on the table and add 3-4 tablespoons of baking soda. Now roll the paper and seal using a rubberband. The next time your shoes smell, prepare such potlis and slide it inside your shoes to free them of the smell.\\n\\n\\nEmpower your wiper\\nDo you have wooden flooring at home and can't use wet mops? Well, there is an easy hack for that - for which you can use paper towels. Slide and tear a big paper towel and attach it to the bottom of your regular wiper - lock it well to the corner too so it doesn't move. Now spray slight water on it or any disinfectant. Mop the floor and you will see how it magically attracts all the mess, keeping your wooden floor clean and clear.\\n\\n\\nUse the roll to save plastic bags\\n\\nWhat do you do when the paper towel roll gets empty - throw it? Well, do not. The plastic bags that you keep stocking here and there can all be stored inside these rolls without creating any clutter.\\n\\n\\nTurn it into a cord organiser\\n\\nAnother brilliant use of the empty roll is to use them as cord organiser. Cut them into two and slide your wires/cord inside to keep them safe and detangled.\\n\\n\\nAren't paper towels more versatile than you think? Dust, declutter and deodorize!\",\n",
    " 'On Wednesday afternoon, singer Chinmayi Sripada tweeted to Union Minister for Women and Child Development Maneka Gandhi and National Commission for Women (NCW), highlighting that no action has been taken after she named Vairamuthu as her predator in the #MeToo movement. She wrote, “Maam, it’s been 4 months since I named Mr Vairamuthu as my predator. I have since then been banned from work in the TN Film Industry (Dubbing Union). The law as of today doesn’t allow me to file a case. Please give me a solution. @PMOIndia (Sic).” Soon after, Maneka Gandhi replied to her, “I have taken up your case with@NCWIndia. Kindly DM your contact details.” Talking to us, the singer says, “I’m grateful that she responded this time. I’m waiting to see if this will lead to something. The NCW has been given complaints before. They just need to take cognizance of complaints and set up an enquiry commission. They could have easily set up a fact-finding committee and called us and the offenders for an enquiry. We don’t know whose door to knock on. So many playback singers have anonymously taken names of their offenders, but since there’s no action, they are not willing to speak up. Solli enna aaga poradhu? Unakku edhavadhu aacha? (What will happen with sharing our story? Did anything happen from your case?) — that’s what they ask. I hope there is a positive outcome now at least.”\\n\\nSruthi hopeful with this move\\n\\nMeanwhile, Kannada actress Sruthi Hariharan, who had come forth with her #MeToo ordeal against actor-filmmaker Arjun Sarja sees this as a significant step. “Chinmayi has been relentless in her pursuit for the #MeTooIndia movement. She has not only stood her ground and fought her case, but has helped many others share their case. I am glad that she tagged Maneka Gandhi and the Prime Minister’s office in her tweet, because she finally got a reply. There are many cases that have gone to the NCW, so this is a start and I am hoping something comes out of it and people realise that this is something that needs to be taken seriously,” she says.\\n\\nSruthi adds, “What is commendable is that Maneka Gandhi has asked political parties to set up Internal Complaints Committees. Every organisation needs one, in every sector. These committees are means by which women can express their voice and concern.”\\n\\nUnlike Chinmayi, who hadn’t got support from the Tamil Nadu State Women’s Commission, Sruthi did in Karnataka, she says. “The women’s commission had filed a suo moto case, as well as one in the cyber crime cell based on the obscene messages that I received on phone and on social media,” explains Sruthi, who adds that she is currently waiting for the next hearing of the case she has filed against Arjun in a court of law.',\n",
    " 'Director Girish G’s anthology of five ‘real’ horror stories is set to release on March 8.

Despite being a horror film, Ond Kathe Hella has been cleared with U/A certification',\n",
    " 'Does it take away anything from a director’s accolades if he acknowledges a source? Does the stature of a director dip if he shares the writing credits? Does it cost a lot to pay a few lakhs to procure rights of Bengali novels/short stories?The answer is a big No.\\nThat’s something Anurag Kashyap understood when he directed Dev.D. He went to town to acknowledge that he was making a modern-day adapatation of Saratchandra Chattopadhyay novel. No one would have dragged him to court had he not mentioned that. Yet, Anurag spoke about his Saratchandra connection. In our own backyard, Buddhadab Dasgupta directed Dooratwa from Sirshendu Mukherjee’s work. His Tahader Katha was based on Kamal Kumar Majumdar’s story by the same name. While his Uttara was adapted from Samaresh Basu’s work, Charachar was an adaptation of a Prafulla Roy work. More recently, when Aparna Sen directed Arshinagar with Dev as Ranajit Mitra and Rittika Sen as Julekha Khan, she mentioned it was a musical adaptation of William Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet.\\n\\nUnfortunately, there are many who find it too difficult to credit a source. That’s why plagiarism charges have been levelled by fans and family members of authors like Moti Nandi, Atin Bandopadhyay and Suchitra Bhattacharya, among others. In some cases, the similarities are coincidental. In others, there is a lot more than that.\\nThe problem is the culture of silence. Most authors don’t protest for fear of problems. But, they crib in privacy while expecting the world around to fight for their rights. Directors, meanwhile, happily ruin the chances of official adaptation rights being sold to those willing to credit.\\nLEGENDS ARE USUALLY SPARED\\nWorks of Rabindranath Tagore, Satyajit Ray, Saratchandra Chattopadhyay, Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay, Saradindu Bandopadhyay, Bibhutibushan Bandopadhyay or Tarashankar Bandopadhyay have largely been credited. When Manas read the three-page Bibhutibushan story titled Taal Nabami, he added some characters and finally, made the 90-minute-long Sahaj Paather Gappo. “It is all about an individual’s ethics. To each his own. For me, giving credit — however little I take from a novel or story — is my duty and responsibility,” says Manas.\\n\\nIS IT AN EGO ISSUE?\\n\\nPerhaps, ego plays an important role. “Even Sunil Gangopadhyay was not spared. An internationally-reputed director had lifted some portions from his Shei Samay while making a movie. Not just films, Bengali serials too have cases where the original writers weren’t credited. A few years back, Atin Bandopadhyay’s Neel Kantha Pakhir Khonje was telecast as a popular serial without acknowledging him. Such controversies were unheard of with directors like Ray, Ghatak or Mrinal Sen. Today’s Tollywood directors try to place themselves in a position which does not rightfully belong to them. They also ignore the financial aspect,” says author Prabal Kumar Basu.\\n\\n\\nTOLLYWOOD’S FIRST-BOY SYNDROME\\n\\nSome directors also end up measuring the extent of the inspiration. But that’s not the point, insists Buddhadeb. “I adapted Mondo Meyer Upakhyan from Prafulla Roy’s short story by the same name. I made Grihajuddha from Dibyendu Palit’s Maach. I made Tope from Narayan Gangopdhyay’s work. In all these cases, I changed a lot from the original works. Trust me, it takes away nothing from a director’s skill if the writing credit goes to someone else. Nobody thought of me as any less of a director for adapting Maach,” says Buddhadeb. This “first-boy syndrome”, he says, is doing harm to the industry. “It’s not that great movies are being made when sources remain undisclosed,” adds Buddhadeb.\\n\\n\\nDOES EVERYONE WANT TO BE A NEW-AGE RAY?\\n\\nJust as a bohemian attitude can’t turn a director into Ritwik Ghatak, being a writer-director too can’t thrust the genius of Ray on makers. Many don’t realise that Bengal still has a fair share of bookworms who can easily identify sources. Some years ago, authors like Sirshendu Mukherjee and Debesh Roy had written to Bangladesh’s information ministry to protest when plagiarism charges were levelled on the makers of Brihannala in Bangladesh for copying Syed Mustafa Siraj’s Gachta Bolecilo. Subsequently, the Bangladesh government cancelled three national film awards bestowed upon Brihannala. Abhijit Siraj, the author’s son, says, “This wouldn’t have happened without a protest. Silence is a crime. Such plagiarism will continue if an author doesn’t have a spine to stand up for his rights.”\\n\\n\\nWell, is everyone listening?',\n",
    " \"The shoot of veteran director Kamal’s next film Pranaya Meenukalude Kadal is on in Lakshadweep and its lead actress Riddhi Kumar is having a gala time on the set, picking up new skills, conversing in Malayalam and more.\\n\\nThe Maharashtra-born actress, who debuted last year in Telugu through the film Lover with Raj Tarun, is, however, no alien to Malayalam.\\n\\n\\n“I played a Malayali nurse in my Telugu debut and still remember lines like Enikku Ee Kalyanam Venda,” Riddhi says, with no hint of difficulty. She adds, “And that was a short line. There were longer lines I had to say, but actress Rohini maam, who was also part of the film, helped me out immensely. I remember a few other words too, like manasilaayi,” says the actress who has done two films in Telugu.\\n\\nRiddhi isn't allowed to speak much about her character, but she discloses she had to be “friendly” with the waters a lot more than she was, till then. “I learnt to swim in the pool but doing the same in sea water was a lot more challenging. It remained scary for a long time but I guess after that first push, I gradually learnt to tame it,” says the actress, who is happy she is getting a lot of help from her crew to learn Malayalam, as well.\\n\\n“My favourite Malayalam word is poocha!” says Ridhi, who apparently befriended a black-coloured kitten who kept hanging around her room and sets during the shoot. “I named her poocha and as I am a vegetarian, I also feed her whatever fish we get with our tiffin,” she says with a chuckle.\",\n",
    " 'He’s playing Uttam Kumar in Soumik Sen’s debut Bengali film, Mahalaya. In a chat with us, Jisshu U Sengupta talks about his experience of playing the legend, childhood memories of Mahalaya, working with the new director and the film. Excerpts:\\nWhat was your first reaction when Soumik approached you to play Uttam Kumar?\\n\\nWhen I heard the script, I was blown away, as I was not aware of the 1976 incident when Uttam Kumar had replaced Birendra Krishna Bhadra’s voice in Mahishasura Mardini. Initially, I was jittery at the thought of playing the legend. But I later realised the film is much more than that.\\n\\n\\nHow challenging was it to step into the shoes of the legend?\\nI’ve played the character in my own way and I request everyone to not compare me with the stalwart. My mother-in-law told me how Uttam Kumar was as a person. She said Uttam babu was witty, big-hearted, a foodie and always eager to help the technicians. These details helped me portray him better. Not for once did I try to copy him.\\n\\nTell us about the film.\\n\\nThe film explores the psyche behind the government’s decision to replace Birendra Krishna Bhadra and tries to answer some popular queries — did Uttam Kumar do it willingly and what was Birendra Krishna Bhadra’s reaction? Did they actually have a fight over this?\\n\\n\\nHow was it working with Soumik?\\n\\nHe is a very sorted director, completely chilled out on the sets. He knows exactly what he wants from his team. It needs courage to make a film like this, so kudos to Bumbada (Prosenjit Chatterjee) for taking the initiative. Not for once did he interfere with the script or anything related to the film. I don’t know how much money the film will make at the box office but it will surely go down in the history of Bengali cinema for its subject. Subhasish Mukhopadhyay’s performance as Birendra Krishna Bhadra is just brilliant.\\n\\n\\nDo you listen to Mahishasura Mardini on Mahalaya?\\n\\nOh yes!

Author Swapnamoy Chakraborty, who also spoke to CT after many pointed out the similarities between the novel, Holde Golap and the film, made a U-turn after watching it on Wednesday. “It’s not a cinematic adaptation of my film,” he said.\\n\\n\\nSaid the author, “I was wary as I had heard about Abul Bashar’s incident, where he felt that his Naram Hridoyer Chinho was plagiarised in Shunyo E Buke. Also, many said Khaad bore resemblances with a film. That’s why I had given the post.” Chakraborty attributed the similarities with a few common sources. “I spoke to several people and also did field survey while penning the story; chances are, Kaushik Ganguly spoke to the same people. If Kaushik today says he hasn’t read my book, I won’t be able to say he’s lying,” said the author.\\n\\n\\nChakraborty, who says the credits appeared on the screen for a fleeting two seconds, said it could have lingered on for a bit more time. “While writing my novel, I spoke to Manabi Bandopadhyay, among others. She gave me valuable inputs. Looks like, she has provided a lot of matter to Kaushik too. But at the end of it, it’s a love story that mine is not. Having said that, I will never disrespect the views of those who pointed out the similarities.” Said Kaushik, “What he had said was out of his concerns about his novel. Though it’s sad that he couldn’t keep faith in me, I am grateful that he finally watched the film and revised his statement. But I’m far more worried about those who aren’t Swapnamoy Chakraborty and made one post after another on social media. During mob violence, the target is sometimes tied to the lamppost and even passers-by, without knowing what is happening, pelt stones at him. Social media has become a violent place. The ones writing against me are those for whom I make films. And every story of mine can be similar to another story happening in some part of the world. I write stories out of my own experiences and another person may be going through the same at some point in time. All I want to say is, think before you act. For tomorrow, you may have to regret for what you are\\n\\ndoing today.”',\n",

    " \"The response that she got since the release of her film 'Pink' two years ago has helped Taapsee Pannu find her footing in the industry. The actress, who is now looking forward to the release of her next, Sujoy Ghosh’s thriller 'Badla', with Amitabh Bachchan, says, “A lot of things happened between 'Pink' and 'Badla' that validated my choices and made me a more confident actor. When 'Pink' happened, I did not know which way my career was going to go. I was trying and testing different films to see where my calling was and when 'Pink' released, it gave me a direction. After that, I was sure of one thing – that I would always take up roles which are part of the main storyline. I mean, if you take out this character from the film, the story will not be the same. The other thing is that I want to play a woman with a spine, because I can connect personally to it and that helps me perform better. The audience response to my work has sort of validated my choice of films.” Taapsee, who was in her hometown Delhi recently, adds that like her previous roles, in 'Badla', she is again playing a strong woman who stands her ground and is confident. She adds, “The character I am playing is pretty confident from the beginning itself. You will not see her vulnerable side, and you won’t see her as someone who would think she is helpless. She knows very well what she wants, she is borderline arrogant because she has made everything for herself from scratch in a foreign land. She has this thing in her mind that no matter what, I will manoeuvre my way out of any situation. She has appointed this lawyer, played by Mr Bachchan in the film. She has hired this man to fight her case, and she has that control over the person she has employed. Like Sujoy’s female characters in his other films like 'Kahaani', this one too is extremely powerful.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThough Taapsee agrees that there are few examples of good, edge-of-the-seat thrillers in Bollywood, she feels that 'Badla' won’t disappoint. “One can’t think of many good thrillers in Bollywood. 'Kahaani' was a good thriller, so was 'Gupt'. Thriller is one of the oldest genres of cinema, but these days, people are not touching it much. The reason could be that it is a very tricky genre, at any point, if your audience can predict the end, your film has fallen flat. You have to keep the audience so engrossed that they are not able to predict the end. Even if you leave theatre for 30 seconds while watching 'Badla', you won’t understand what has happened, you won’t be able to connect the dots,” says Taapsee, who will be sharing screen space with Bachchan again in 'Badla' after 'Pink'. “My confidence level was surely different this time when I worked with him. After 'Pink', I share a certain comfort level in working with him, but even in 'Pink' working with him was never intimidating for me. I am not a very star-struck person, may be because of the fact that I didn’t grow up obsessing over films. I had seen Mr Bachchan’s films while having lunch or dinner with family, but it’s not like I have grown in awe of all the actors. I only get intimidated when I am with a bunch of extremely talented actors, where I know I am not a trained actor, which happened in 'Mulk' with me. But I enjoy working with Mr Bachchan. People think I must be blanking out when I look into his eyes and perform, but I actually get excited,” she says.\\n\\n\\nFACEBOOKTWITTERPINTREST\",\n",

And at the recent Oscar Awards it was another shade of the colour that stood out as the most popular fashion trend for the night — bright pink! There was almost a sea of gowns in the hue — in poufy frills, netted ruffles, princess-style trail gowns, bubble-gum hued tulles and more. It’s being described by fashion analysts as ‘joyful’ and ‘what modern couture should be like’. As it upped the sartorial ante, it got fashion pundits asking: Is pink the new black?\\nHollywood royalty gives it the nod\\n\\n\\n(L-R) Actress Angela Bassett’s wore a vivid fuchsia gown with a massive bow and pretty clutch and actress Helen Mirren looked equally stunning in her A-line dress with contrasting pink hues\\n\\n\\n(L-R) Actress Sarah Paulson’s princess-like gown had edgy, side cut-outs and actress Linda Cartellini wowed in a poofy, bubblegum-hued gown\\n\\nThe attention-grabbing pink dresses were seen on a bunch of stars. ‘Crazy Rich Asians’ star Gemma Chan wore a voluminous gown in magenta. She also snuck a cookie into her pockets to probably munch on during the whole event. While Linda Cardellini seemed to pile on pink stylishly, Kacey Musgraves stole it with her cotton-candy-pink tulle net ensemble and Sarah Paulson opted for a billowy, cutout-style fuchsia gown. But it was veteran actress Angela Bassett who was the reigning queen of the night as most sites called her. She turned heads in her exaggerated hot pink shoulder gown with its thigh-high slit and a gem-shaped clutch. Also in close running for wearing the hue stylishly were actresses Helen Mirren and Julia Roberts. Mirren swished in with her frothy pink tulle and Roberts dished up Oscars chic in her flowy-but-fitted one-shouldered bright pink dress with an asymmetrical leg slit. And guess what?

Men can look just as hot in the hue. Jason Momoa wore a pink velvet tux with a matching scrunchie to the awards and 'Black Panther' actor Chadwick Boseman also chose the hue for the Oscars after party.\\n\\n\\nHow to wear the hue in your day\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhile shocking pink and its cousins heated up the red carpet at the Oscars, you can just as easily wear the hue in your daily life. Here are tips to do so:\\n\\n- Pink is the colour for any season — it adds vibrancy to winter and lends a lovely hue to summer. So, go with skater, shift dresses and other styles in it, for the upcoming season.\\n- Yes, this is a pretty shade, but you don’t want to look too girly in it, so break the monotony of the hue with black, navy blue and grey.\\n- Since pink is also a light shade, it is perfect for those ruffles, frills and poufs.\\n- Keep away the stiff, black heels and make pink your new neutral footwear. Opt for pumps, peep toes, kitten heels and stilettos in bright or baby pink.\\n\\n- Planning to wear all-black? Pink comes in as the perfect complement. Wear pink stud earrings or hoops as well a pop pink clutch or quilted bag to go with the rest of the look.\\n\\n- Love athleisure? Weave pink into your gym wear with pink keds, tracks with a neon pink stripe or even a fuchsia top over those black leggings.\\n\\n- Team a pink halter with white jeans for a day outdoors.\\n\\n- Grab a pair of sunnies with a pink frame to complete the look. Dab on the eyeshadow to match.\",\n",

    " 'It usually happens that after reaching the age of 18-20 years, an autistic individual no more receives the kind of educational support that is offered at a younger age. Apart from certain specific training programmes, the individual is often excluded from other help. While education remains a life-long process for everyone else, a large number of autistic individuals are deprived of it at an early age,” says artist and art consultant Sneha Joshi, who is curating Eye Contact: An insight into autism — a special event in Bengaluru.\\n\\nWhile the primary goal of the initiative is to raise awareness about the developmental disorder, help erase the stigma around it and make art more accessible to autistic individuals, the event —which comprises an exhibition, a performance and a panel discussion — also aims at forming a more inclusive society that embraces marginalised communities and help them thrive. “We want to take conversations about autism to public places and open forums, where people can participate and discuss issues and possible solutions. This would not only enable young adults suffering from this disorder express themselves, but also create a comfort zone for them to identify their inherent talents and showcase them,” explains Sneha, who has an autistic brother. Family narratives as well as personal experiences of caretakers are other focus areas of the initiative. According to Sneha, art and media can be instrumental in making society more inclusive. The event will be conducted by Colours Centre for Learning, in association with The Be A Smile Project — a research project investigating autism and society. It’s taking place from April 5-7 at Rangoli – Metro Art Centre.\\n\\n\\nThe showcase will include paintings, video work, pictures, as well as interactive activities for visitors.

    " 'Many ‘new’ comedians have made a mark for themselves in Kollywood of late and are doing back-to-back films. But Vivekh’s comedy, which often touches upon social causes, still remains the favourite of many Kollywood film buffs. The veteran actor, who still gives young comedians a run for their money, thanks to his spontaneity and thought-provoking one-liners, is gung-ho about his upcoming projects, among which he considers Vellai Pookal to be unique. In a freewheeling chat withus, he talks about topics that include movies, nature conservation, sexual crimes, caste system, and more...\\nLooks like Vellai Pookal isn’t ‘your kind of film’. You are playing a serious cop and have sported salt ‘n’ pepper looks, too…\\nIt all started when the film’s director Vivek Elangovan, a US-based Microsoft engineer, approached me with a story. But I was skeptical about the project even materialising when the makers said they wanted me to go to the US. They needed my dates for a month and asked me to go to Seattle. Later, they sent me the summary of the film, but I said I need the entire script, which has details of every scene irrespective of the number of scenes I’m a part of. After going through it, I felt this is a script which someone who has Sathyaraj sir’s physique and screen presence would do justice to. But they convinced me by saying that audience will be prepared to watch certain scenes with actors who have not done such roles before. I play a retired DIG (Intelligence) who goes to the US to meet his son, with whom he has had a difference of opinion. Audience expect comedy from me, so I had reservations initially. But then, I felt this is the right time to try something different. Our viewers are yearning for novelty these days and they appreciate honest and innovative attempts.\\n\\nHow has the industry reacted to your makeover?\\nMany of them loved it. AR Rahman has always been a good friend of mine. I showed him the teaser and he was impressed by it. I asked him if he could do music and he said he has his hands full. We told him that we can wait till he gets sometime from his hectic schedule. Though we waited for a year, he couldn’t do it because of his busy assignments.\\nThere is an influx of thrillers in Kollywood now. How is this film going to be different?\\nThe good thing is all these films were received well, which is an advantage for our project, too. Our film has lot of mind games and edge-of-the-seat moments with ample emotions. Though most artistes in it are from the US, Charlie, Pooja Devariya and newbie Dev have interesting roles in it.\\n\\nWhat are your other projects?\\nThese days, many seem to be embracing agriculture. I have been thinking about a movie on farming and related stuff and am currently writing a script — it needs a commercially viable hero. I will be directing the movie, too, which will have humour as its main attraction, though the content discussed in it will be quite serious and relevant.\\n\\nYou are teaming up with Vijay after a long time in Atlee’s upcoming film.\\nWe are teaming up after more than a decade. Kuruvi was the last film we did together. He had called me up recently and said that he’s happy to join hands with me again. Vijay told me “we should rock” and Atlee is keen on portraying me in a jovial role. I’m excited to join the team soon.\\n\\nThere was news on you teaming up with Sivakarthikeyan\\nThat was actually news for me as well. Siva had once said that I’m his inspiration for doing comedy. I would love to do a movie with him.\\n\\nYou had a small role in Viswasam which went on to become one of the top grossing films in the state\\nI’m so happy the movie did well. Siva approached me and said that my role comes only in the second half. He said there are scenes where I have to make fun of Ajith’s character and that I would be the best person for the same. We had some beautifully shot scenes, but couldn’t retain it. There is a scene where I utter his popular dialogue “en vazhkaila ovvoru naalum ovvoru nimishamum yen ovvoru nodiyaiyum naana sedhukkunadhu da” to him, to which he gives a funny counter. Fans would have loved that scene has it been retained. It was a pleasure to work again with Nayanthara after a decade, as well.\\n\\nAre there any recent movies from which you enjoyed comedy thoroughly?\\nThere are many and it would be difficult to choose a few among them. The style of comedy in cinema has now changed. The average duration of a movie was more than 2.30 hours when Vadivelu and I used to have separate comedy tracks. Now people are impatient and can’t sit through a movie which is more than two hours. Even when watching movies of lesser duration, they get sidetracked with mobile videos and messages on phone. So, we comedians do not get so much of time to create an impact. People who perform in Tik Tok and YouTube channels have more followers these days because they have the liberty to take as much as time they want to. It’s difficult to perform full-fledged comedy like how I did in films like Saamy, Kadhal Sadugudu, Uthamaputhiran, Maapillai, Padikkathavan, etc.\\n\\nIs there a movie after watching which you felt disappointed not being a part of it?\\nI was in talks with the veteran filmmaker KC Bokadia for a political film which had good dose of humour. That was around the time LKG and NOTA were announced, and went on floors. And so Bokadia’s film was scrapped. But after watching LKG, I felt we should have gone ahead with our movie as well. Our project would also have been liked by audience.\\n\\n\\nLooks like we are heading towards a scorching summer this year. As a nature enthusiast, do you think we are taking our natural resources for granted?\\nI have now completed planting 30.23 lakh saplings and have 70 lakh more to complete the mission given by the beloved Abdul Kalam sir. I have always been vocal about preserving water and living a nature-friendly life. Many homes here haven’t received metro water for a long time. People are slowly realising that depending on AC while staying indoors will not work. In places like Pudukottai and other delta areas, you get bore water only after digging 2,000 ft deep. Of late, many people talk about the need to provide water to birds. The unfortunate fact is that human beings are also running short of water. At least five trees should be planted for every tree which is cut down.\\n\\n\\nTo what extent do you think the #MeToo movement has created an impact in the film industry here?\\nI think awareness has been created now. Our culture has always been about treating women as mothers. It is sad that women are treated as mere sex objects by many. Even small children are being sexually abused. Sexual perversion, frustration and depression are turning people into beasts. Only stringent punishment can control such incidents. When an accused gets bail easily and such cases take years to get a verdict, people aren’t really worried about the law. The easy access to pornography is another reason why, I think, there is an increase in the number of such crimes. We never had so many shocking crimes two or three decades ago. In such cases, 25 per cent is due to the influence of cinema and 75 per cent because of unlimited access to pornography.\\n\\n\\nAs a socially-conscious person what do you think are things which require urgent attention?\\nWe need self-sufficient farmers, massive planting of trees, innovative ways to conserve water and proper education. Education is the key to abolishing caste system. There was a time I felt such discrimination is coming to an end, but sadly, it has only come up all over again in the recent times. Even in today’s age of WhatsApp, Facebook, latest gadgets and communication facilities, people are discussing caste and using these apps to instigate communal riots.',\n",

I believe in the adage, cross the bridge when you get there.\\n\\n‘I am working with Rajen uncle since two years and he is nothing less than a father to me. From guiding me to making me learn all the nitty-gritty of acting — he has taught me a lot. He sometimes shouts at us but I know it’s to make sure we give our best. What I like the most about him is his approach towards a scene. He gives a lot of space to his actors and always asks them to act logically. The credit for the serial’s popularity goes entirely to him. His constant suggestion to us is that we shouldn’t let success go to our heads’\\n— Ditipriya Roy (who plays the titular character)\\n\\nBabu Banik\\nKnown for: Jahaanara\\n\\nOther significant works: Jahaanara is my 19th serial. Previously I have worked on Niyoti, Bodhu Boron, Amar Durga, Jamai Raja to name a few. My first direction was for Raat Bhor Bhristi followed by Ei Ghor Ei Songsar, Heroes and Lukhochuri. Three to four of my serials have crossed more than 1,000 episodes. I believe that’s no mean feat!\\nWhat makes his serial/serials stand out: I deal with bold subjects like triple talaq in Jahaanara. There’s no show on Bengali television that has touched upon this topic. The serial revolves around a Muslim girl, Jahaanara, who speaks for the rights of women. The serial is about women emancipation — told through the story of a Muslim girl — and that I believe is its uniqueness.\\n\\n\\n\\nBig screen aims: I got a lot of offers to do remakes but I have maintained a strict no-no. I want to direct original films. I am currently working on two scripts. One is about a father-daughter relationship. Actor Arindam Ganguly and Kheyali Dastidar, who are my mentors, have arranged a meeting with Prosenjit Chatterjee because I wrote the script keeping Bumbada in mind. That apart, there is another script for which we are trying to get Nawazuddin Siddiqui on board. The story is about a guy who loses his wife due to gambling!\\n\\n‘Jahaanara is my debut serial. Babuda is a very senior director but not for once has he made me feel like a newcomer. He explains a scene so well that there is hardly any room for confusion. And during late-night shoots, when we are all low on energy, he will shout, ‘mood chai team, mood ano’ and we immediately get all charged up!’\\n— Sweta Mishra (who plays the titular character)\\n\\nBabu Banik\\nKnown for: Jahaanara\\n\\nOther significant works: I started my career as an assistant director in films like Bindaas, Majnu, Byomkesh Bakshi and Tor Naam. Later, I worked as an episode director for serials like Deep Jwele Jai and Soubhaggobati. I have debuted as a full-time director with Joyee.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat makes his serial/serials stand out: The story revolves around Joyee, who plays football and at the same time, looks after her household. She balances both the world and represents women in today’s time who strike a balance between thriving careers and happy homes. It encourages today’s youth to straddle both the worlds with ease. I try to lend a cinematic touch to the serial and I guess that makes it look different from the others.\\n\\nBig screen aims: My ambition is to direct a thriller. I would love to cast Ritwick Chakraborty and Rudranil Ghosh in my debut film; that is if they are convinced with the story.\\n\\n‘Arghyada’s dedication shows when he is behind the camera. He is like a guardian to\\nthe unit. He is a great team leader’\\n— Debadrita Basu\\n(who plays the titular character)\\n\\n\\nAmit Sengupta\\nKnown for: Debi Chaudhurani\\n\\nOther significant works: I have directed more than 18-20 serials so far, including Khona, Kajori, Gouridaan, Subho Bibaho, Sedin Dujone, Kajallata and Meera.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat makes his serial/serials stand out: The life story of Debi Chaudhurani itself is the serial’s USP. The peroid drama, led by a woman protagonist, is set in a time when most women did not even show her face to men outside her immediate family. The show brings alive the story of Prafulla, an ordinary girl and her inspiring journey to become Debi Chaudhurani, a leader and warrior loved and respected by everyone.\\n\\nBig screen aims: I’m working towards my goal of directing a film and I’m certain it will happen at the right time. There are a few stories in my mind.\\n\\n‘This is my debut serial and I feel honoured to work with Amitda. From dialogue delivery to how to face the light — I have learned a lot from him. I wouldn’t be able to deliver difficult scenes if it wasn’t for Amitda’\\n— Sona Moni Saha (who plays the titular character)\\n\\n\\nKamalesh Biswas\\nKnown for: Ke Apon Ke Por\\n\\nOther significant works: I have worked as episode director in more than 25 mega serials like Protidaan, Jibon Jyoti, Agnijol, Tomay Amay Mile, Kotha Dilam and Bamakhepa. Ke Apon Ke Por is my debut serial as a director.\\n\\nWhat makes his serial/serials stand out: Ke Apon Ke Por is a huge hit among the audience because of its storyline. The story revolves around Jaba, who starts out as a domestic help and goes on to establish herself as someone who’s well suited to be the daughter-in-law of the household and a lawyer by profession. The story stresses on the fact that everything is possible if one has the determination and perseverance.\\n\\nBig screen aims: I have worked as an assistant director in films like Glamour and Risk. But I’d love to direct a film someday. I’m already working on a story about a town where people are trying to bring in changes for the betterment of the public but are facing opposition from the government. I would love to cast Sohini Sarkar and Anirban Bhattacharya in this film.\\n\\n‘This is the first time that I’m working with Kamaleshda and I’m thankful to him for teaching me the nuances of acting. The best part about him is that he never loses his cool on the sets and guides each and every actor so they can perform\\nbetter. He does his homework well so there is a method to his direction’\\n— Pallabi Sharma (who plays Jaba in the serial)\\n\\n\\nSubho (Subhashis Mondal)\\n\\nPopular for: Mahaprabhu Sree Chaitanya\\n\\nOther significant works: I started my career as an assistant director and got a lot of appreciation for my work in serials like Agnipariksha and Rashi. Radha, for which I was an episode director, got me a lot of praise because the audiences thought the serial was nothing less than a film look-wise. Mahaprabhu Sree Chaitanya is the first serial that I am directing and I am grateful that the audience has shown so much love for it.\\n\\n\\nWhat makes his work stand out: In today’s world of violence and hatred, the serial Mahaprabhu Sree Chaitanya tries to establish the fact that love and compassion still exist. Not only do I work on subjects that are relatable but I also try to shoot in a way that the serial looks realistic.\\n\\n\\nBig-screen plans: My dream is to direct a film someday. I’m already working on a few scripts that delve into topics like homosexuality and prostitution. I’m also planning to direct a love story where I want to cast Gaurav Chakrabarty and Ridhima Ghosh. For my debut film, I’d love to cast Abir Chatterjee and Parambrata Chatterjee.',\n",

The film, directed by debutant Anoop Panicker, went on floors on Monday, and the actress says that she needed to do a lot of prep work to get ready to play this role. “We have seen this character in investigative films, but here, the entire script revolves around one. Playing a forensic pathologist requires maturity and knowledge about the subject,” begins the actress.\\n\\nHaving taken computer science group in school and not being interested in the field of medicine then, Amala says that she needs a lot of support to play this role. “The script is by Abhilash Pillai, and he has taken inspiration from the book Oru Police Surgeonate Ormakurippukal by Dr Umadathan, a famous forensic surgeon in Kerala. I got a lot of insights into the character by reading the book. I also met Dr Umadathan and spoke to him about his work,” she informs.\\n\\n\\nAmala, who will not have any romantic pair in the film, also travelled with a forensic surgeon for a couple of days, both while he was at work and outside of it, to get to know more about their work and life. “I kept asking him a lot of questions on the nature of his work. I was trying to glean as much inspiration from him as possible. I don’t think I have had to do this much prep work, especially in terms of reading, for any of my roles so far,” she states.\\n\\nInterestingly, the film will also see her turning producer for the first time. “The script demanded a certain kind of budget as it has to be shot on a lot of sets and locations. It is also somewhat dark and intense, and I felt that creative freedom was important if we were to make it that way. These are the kind of subjects that I firmly believe in, and if I don’t support the kind of films that I believe in, then, who will?” she asks.\\n\\n\\nThe cast includes Athulya, Harish Uthaman and Ramesh Khanna among others.

Although she’s done some Telugu films in the meantime, she took her time to pick her next Kannada film. Why? “Being born and brought up here, I am more careful with the Kannada films I pick,” Kruthika says. In a breezy chat, she tells us about her role in Kavacha, what she looks for in films and more…\\nYou play a woman much older than yourself in Kavacha…\\nYes, I play Revathy, who is a woman aged 35-40 years. Director GVR Vasu didn’t want to rely on makeup to make me look older — he wanted me to actually look the part. So, I had to put on 10-12 kgs. And this I had to do in a very short span on time. I had about 1.5 weeks before shooting began, during which time I put on around 8-10 kgs. I managed to do this by cutting out on exercise and eating non-stop. My body is such that I can put on and lose weight easily, so the challenge was to maintain continuity, but not keep putting on more weight.\\n\\n\\nSo, what’s Revathy like? She works in the same apartment complex as Shivarajkumar’s character. She cares for him a lot and is his main pillar of support. They are both mature characters and there is a silent undercurrent between them.\\n\\n\\nHow did Kavacha happen to you?\\n\\nSince the director is from Hyderabad, he had seen my work in Telugu films. He first asked me to watch the original (the Malayalam film Oppam) and tell him if I was ready to play the part. I am quite new to the film industry, so being presented with an opportunity like Kavacha was huge for me. A lot of people asked me why I would want to play someone much older than me this early on in my career, but how do you say no to working with Shivanna?\\n\\n\\nWhy the long break in Sandalwood?\\n\\nI consciously take slow decisions. I get a lot of offers, but I don’t want to do a movie just for the sake of it. I want each movie I do to have some value, and I want to be remembered for them. And I got that with Kavacha. Although I’m not on screen for a long time, I play a key role and add value to the film. Being born and brought up in Bengaluru, I am more careful with the Kannada films I pick.',\n",

    " \"He’s the guy who rages and roars on screen, ripping apart the wrong doers with deadly vengeance that makes you shudder and scream, but it feels real. He walks through the walls and doors, with every sinew in that 100-kilo body, throbbing with energy. And be forewarned, you can’t mess with the man in real life, too. He doesn’t mince words when he says, “It is very difficult to tell me lies and get away with it. There is nothing that will get past me.” His action avatar aside, what John really loves delving into is history and world politics, and understanding how all of that impacts human lives. In a chat with BT, the actor excitedly talks about his upcoming spy thriller, 'RAW (Romeo, Akbar, Walter)', a story that’s inspired by true events from the 1971 Indo-Pak war, his views on social media activism and how he will always stand up and speak his mind, through his stories on celluloid. Read on...\\nStories that stem from real incidents and significant episodes in history have always interested you ('Madras Café', 'Parmanu: The Story Of Pokhran', and the upcoming 'Batla House'). So, what clinched it specifically for 'RAW'? Also, the mood of the country is different now from what it was a year ago, post the heinous Pulwama attack. Hence, films with a political backdrop need to be doubly sure that they are touching the right chord with the audience. Would you agree?\\nI read the script and I wanted to do it, I knew this was a fantastic story. I was fortunate that Robbie Grewal (writer-director) approached me, though he didn’t expect me to do it. The minute I heard it, I was floored and the first thing I told him was that this is not flaky stuff; the film is so well-researched. Robbie has grown up in an army background; his father was part of the military intelligence, so the subject is close to his heart. Both Robbie and I are intrinsically India lovers. The good thing is that this film is not jingoistic or overtly patriotic. It does not get into the zone of bashing other countries, it is a thriller. Just like 'Raazi', which was after all a human story, this one is, too. Unfortunately for us, the film is releasing post the Pulwama attacks. It has been in the making for a year. In fact, it was always meant to release between March 15 and April 12, you can find it mentioned in the industry trade magazines. We pushed the date ahead to April 5. We know that unfortunately, the film resonates with the mood of the country, but it’s not pre-planned.\\n\\n'RAW' is inspired by true events, and set against the backdrop of the Indo-Pak war of 1971. How much have you personally researched the events that happened during that period? And while doing that, did it throw up interesting insights and give you a different perspective on the subject?\\nWhen I hear stories about wars from people in general, they mostly come from a space of ignorance, pardon me for saying this. In this case, a huge amount of research has gone into the film; I give all credit to Robbie for it. On my part, I think the fact that I am politically aware and I know what has historically happened in the world around us, helps while telling such stories. Subjects like 'Madras Café', 'Parmanu: The Story Of Pokhran', 'Batla House' and 'RAW' is the space that I dwell in. We shot this film in Kashmir, in the middle of a shootout that happened during Eid. We know and understand the mood of the region and are aware of the history of what has happened there for a long time. When you make a film on a sensitive subject, you have to be very responsible in your storytelling. You cannot fudge anything, or take creative liberties, it has to be factual. My biggest source of information was of course, Robbie and all that he had gathered from his father. Other than that, I have read numerous books on the pre-Partition and post-Partition eras. I generally read a lot on such subjects, so if you ask me about what’s happening in Syria, Ecuador, Venezuela or any other part of the world, I am well-informed. I like understanding why there is conflict, where it is coming from and what is the root of it all. You understand all this, process it, and then, when you read Twitter hashtags that tell you… say yes to this, say no to that, I feel bad. You need to have the right information before Tweeting and commenting on such serious issues.\\nYes, social media commentary is common these days and it is often misleading. There is no dearth of armchair activists on social media platforms, people who have an opinion on most issues and dole out advice on various subjects. There are some who genuinely make an impact, but a huge number of them say things out of line to simply draw attention…\\nI would say that it is dangerous. If you are saying something that is sensitive, you rather not say it if you are not backed by the knowledge to comment on the subject. The most dangerous thing in this world is low IQ and high confidence. It can’t get worse than that.\\n\\nWhile you might have strong views on pertinent issues and you are well-informed, one does not see you participating in debates, discussions, or commenting on burning issues (political, social or otherwise) on such forums...\\nI keep telling people that I am not in the business of trending on social media. I do not want to be in a space where I have to be in the news and say something exceptional that will trend. In our line of work, things have changed so much. Earlier, a producer would take you to a hoarding in Juhu and tell you, ‘Look, here is where you are’. Now, the same producer says, ‘Look, you are trending at number one and you are tracking so well’. It might make some actors happy, but I have seen film promotions that have got the fastest 100 million views online, but then, what’s happened to some of those films after they hit the theatres? I feel that a good film will always find its audience. So, my point is, just make a good film, and don’t worry how it is tracking, trending or anything else.\\n\\nYou have backed good films as a producer and made brave choices with movies that went on to make a mark at the box office. Do you think that made industry folks build more faith in you as an actor, too?\\nYes, people take my word for it and I am very responsible with my words. If I tell a certain studio that this content is good, they take my word for it, as they trust my instinct and know that I would be saying the right thing. I think I have worked hard for that. Ever since I turned producer, I have always gone with my instinct and taken risks. We released 'Parmanu: The Story Of Pokhran' during the IPL semi-finals, it was like committing hara-kiri. I had gone through a court case with the producer (Prerna Arora), but I saw that release through and it taught me a lot. I learnt a lot about the legal process and how things work in court. I learnt a lot about distribution and about everything else under the sun. In some of my interviews during that time, I had said that it is very difficult to tell John lies and get away with it. There is nothing that can fool me or will get past me.\\n\\nYou took a strong stand and fought it out in court, and others followed...\\n(Cuts in)… I will always take a stand, even as an actor when I am working on my movies. I am not one of those politically correct actors who is pro-India, but will not say anything that will antagonise anybody. I won’t make a political statement just to trend on social media, but I will say things as they are, as they are meant to be said and I will say it through my films.\\n\\n\\nYou recently said that looking ahead, you can see your best five years coming up (as an actor and producer). The fact that the audience’s appetite for cinema is growing, actors are getting greedier for better and well-written roles and that there is a plethora of options for actors to choose from, has a huge role to play in the benchmark you have set for your career goals. Right?\\n\\nYes, even going ahead, I will only develop content. I will work with the new Ayushmanns (Khurrana) of the world and new directors. I will give them opportunities, and at the end of the day, who will be the hero? The content. Nothing else will drive the film other than good content. I look at it from the audience’s perspective, as I converse a lot with my audience. Why did I become a producer in the first place? For two reasons, firstly, as an actor, I wasn’t getting the kind of films that I wanted to do. Secondly, I wasn’t getting to watch the kind of films I wanted to watch as an audience. If you see my trajectory as an actor before I turned producer and post that, there is a quantum leap. It is because I am doing films which I am convinced that I am meant to do, and I am saying this with all humility. I am a learner, I have learnt through the process. I couldn’t understand the garish performances and overacting that was considered good acting when I first came into the industry, where my subtle acting was considered underacting. People would think, ‘He is not acting’. Today, that subtle acting is considered good. The audience’s tastes have changed and we are at that inflection point, where there is need for content, new-age cinema, subtleties in performances, and everything I am here for.\\n\\n\\nEven while you are doing these content-heavy films, I assume that you would still want to be seen as Action Abraham, the kickass action hero, right? Also, today, the action in our films has gone notches higher (as far as skill, technique and style are concerned). Do you see it scaling up even further?\\nYou could do the best action in this country, but it will not work if you don’t connect emotionally with the story. If the EQ (emotional quotient) is good and the action is average, your film will still do wonders. So, I feel that movies here still run on emotions, not on great action. Think of this…who are your biggest action heroes? Bruce Willis, Sylvester Stallone, Dwayne Johnson, Arnold Schwarzenegger, these are the massive action heroes of Hollywood. What is common between all of them? None of them can really do action…it is their attitude that makes them such huge action heroes. When Arnold says, ‘I will be back’, it’s the way he says it that stays with you. It is the attitude that makes an action hero, not the action itself.\\n\\n\\nGiven how involved you are in every aspect of filmmaking, you must have given some thought to the idea of turning director, too?\\nYes, I have. I will direct someday. I get a lot of hope when I see films directed by artistes like Bradley Cooper, Clint Eastwood and Robert Redford. They are actors who are also such fine directors, they inspire me.\",\n",
    " \"Chuck Russell ‘directed’ a real elephant herd for the first time in his life for 'Junglee'. He tells us that it was very important for him that the elephants were comfortable and happy, which is why he brought no animal trainers along with him for the shoot – the default Hollywood way. Chuck wanted to work only with the elephants and their mahouts, which elicited grim warnings from his Hollywood colleagues. But for the director, the journey which began in fear soon transformed into respect, and then love. “I’ve worked with a guy who’s a legend in Hollywood, Sled Reynolds (animal trainer Paul ‘Sled’ Reynolds) who did 'Tarzan', 'The Ape Man' (1981) with Bo Derek, he did 'The Scorpion King' for me. He was kind of a mentor for me in working with animals, and he told me, ‘Chuck, do not go out there and think you’re the elephant whisperer. They are very dangerous, wild animals’. He wanted me to take some of his trainers with me and he basically made me promise not to get too close to the elephants. Because elephants can kill you accidentally,” says Chuck, and then adds with a chuckle, “I haven’t sent him the trailer yet, ‘coz he’s going to kill me! I did tell him that I wanted to work with the mahouts, and he just... This is the Hollywood thinking, and Sled is a master. But 'Junglee' is a different situation. This is a real herd of elephants, with each having a mahout that stays with his/her elephant for life. So this was a much more naturalistic approach to shooting elephants.”\\n\\n\\nWhat fears did he bring with him? “From the beginning, I knew it was dangerous,” replies Chuck, “Our protocols were developed one step at a time until I felt it was safe. Vidyut was always at the lead because he’s got his own opinion about what is safe, but around the animals, it was only respect. I didn’t tell them when to work, they told me. We earned their trust first, and then I was amazed at the things that happened between them. So it was a slow process, I was there a couple of weeks before we started filming, Vidyut spent a couple of weeks just with Bhola. And then we brought the rest of the crew in.”\\n\\n\\nHe adds, “By the time we were done, we knew what he liked, we knew his apples. Bhola does not let other people approach him. Just his mahout, and Vidyut and fortunately, myself, thanks to the time we spent together. So this was a legit wildlife adventure. I couldn’t do a movie about my love for elephants and the fact that we could lose them, unless the elephants I worked with were truly safe, happy and enjoyed working on our set.”\",\n",
    " \"Hunar Gandhi calls herself a Delhi girl. Her association with the national capital is quite old. The 'Patiala Babes' actress has lived and shot for two shows ('Dahleez' and '12/24 Karol Bagh') in Delhi, and now owns a house in Gurgaon with actor-husband Mayank Gandhi. Although Delhi and Gurgaon are far from similar, to Hunar, it’s all the same. “For those of us who come from Bombay, Gurgaon is Delhi. I still cannot differentiate between the two,” she says, “It has happened so many times that I’d come to our Gurgaon house and someone from my in-laws would say, ‘Main Delhi jaa raha hoon’, and I’d say, ‘Hum Delhi mein hi toh hain’. But now, after spending more time here, I know it’s a separate city.” Hunar laments that she hasn’t explored Gurgaon as much as Delhi. “I know Delhi quite well. I shot in places like Karol Bagh and Chhatarpur, so I know the food and the people very well. But I haven’t had a chance to explore Gurgaon. When I go somewhere new, I always gorge on the city’s food first. The street food shops in Gurgaon will be my first stop.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHunar has some fond memories of shooting in Delhi, particularly the outdoor shoots in Karol Bagh. “I remember we once shot at Ajmal Khan Road with a hidden camera set-up, and it was so fun because people didn’t know we were shooting,” she recounts, adding, “Bas Delhi ki ek baat buri hai. Yahan stalkers bahut aa jaate hain. And I don’t know how, but logon ko yahan phone number bhi badi jaldi mil jaate hain aapke.” On the work front, Hunar’s role of ‘the other woman’ Meeta in 'Patiala Babes', is being appreciated by the audience. She says, “I knew this role had to be different from the usual other women roles you see in soaps, and I’m glad I have been able to bring that out. I wanted her to be a well-rounded human being, and not just shades of black or white. I am happy that it is being appreciated by the audience. When have you ever seen people sympathizing with the other woman in a TV show?”\",\n",
    " 'Television couple Tannaz and Bhakhtyar Irani lived their worst nightmare in the wee hours yesterday, when a part of their bungalow caught fire. The accident took place after the main junction box installed outside the passage blew up. Fortunately, timely intervention averted a major tragedy.\\nThe incident took place around 3.30 am when everyone was asleep. Tannaz shudders as she recalls the incident, “Bhakhtyar and I were sleeping in our room, when our househelp called me from the children’s room, inquiring about the power cut. I asked Bhakhtyar to look into it and within a few minutes of him stepping out, I heard him scream. He is not the one to panic easily. So, I rushed out, and was shocked to see fire in the passage. There were huge flames and smoke reaching inside the house. Fortunately, our neighbour helped us diffuse it by using blankets and kitchen napkins. Bhakhtyar was a real-life hero; he managed to bring the fire down after working relentlessly for 45 minutes. Thankfully, the fire brigade and police also came in time.”\\n\\n\\n\\nThe actress adds, “This has been a big lesson for us. Every home should have a fire extinguisher. Now, we don’t have power supply, and I have sent the kids and dog to my mother-in-law’s home, which is close by, to catch up on some sleep.”\\n\\nTannaz and Bhakhtyar had informed their friends and well-wishers about the accident on social media. On a lighter note, the actress shares, “Given that the incident took place on April 1, many people thought that we were fooling them.

    " 'Finding true relationships —friends or lovers — in general, is hard. While you might find a good friend or true lover by hanging out with him or her in person, people often wonder if having a network of contacts on social media, who you have never met, can be called friends, too. Are social media relations as deep and meaningful as long-standing friendships in the real world?\\n\\nWith the soaring popularity of such platforms, people tend to communicate less in person and more online. According to a recent American study, 76 per cent teenagers use social media. While some might assume that online relationships are transient, fleeting and shallow, others feel that sometimes you can be more honest with a social media friend, than communicating with someone directly. That’s because, though the mediums are different, the bond you share with someone online is as intense as it would be with someone you meet.\\n“Social media and dating apps are excellent avenues to find new companions. But often, it is equated to finding a friend with benefits. If you find someone who seems genuine, make sure you don’t get physically or financially involved. Be it friendship or love, it’s best to take things slow, initially,” says Dr Rohann Bokdawala, psychiatrist.\\n\\nTrust is the key\\nEven when you communicate with someone on a digital medium, there’s still human interaction. If you like talking to someone on social media and you share common interests and topics you’re passionate about, you may have found a true relation.\\n\\n\\n\\nCity-based Anuradha Tiwari has been friends with Saemah Khan for over a decade. They connected on a social networking site via a mutual friend and their bond turned into long-lasting friendship. “Saemah is like a sister to me. When we interacted for the first time, we argued over a mutual friend’s post. But later, we clicked and became best of friends. We met for the first time at Bandra station for five minutes, and bonded well. We have been by each other’s side through thick and thin. Her family loves me and vice versa,” says Anuradha, who feels that trust, time and patience are the key ingredients for finding the right bond on social media.\\n\\nExperts say it’s important to trust your gut when you are bonding with a person on social media. If you like talking to him or her, be frank about who you are. You can’t start a friendship or bond based on pretenses. Saemah says that their mutual understanding and willingness to hear each other out worked when they connected on a social networking site. Explaining how they trusted each other, Saemah adds, “When we realised that we don’t judge each other for what we say or opine, the trust strengthened. I feel every bond, whether it’s with someone you meet regularly or a social media contact, takes time. So, we started meeting occasionally, mostly on birthdays, and our friendship bloomed with every meeting. I loved her honesty and our wavelength matched.”\\n\\nIs it love?\\nWhile some find true friends on social media, some find true love and subsequent life partners, too. Pooja Advani, a PR professional from Mumbai, connected with Omkar Pawaskar on social media in 2015. They fell in love and eventually, got married.\\n\\n\\n\\n“We met after chatting for a month on the site. The first meeting was awkward for both of us, but we got along in subsequent meetings. We realised that our choices in terms of food and music, and expectations from life, were similar. We were always transparent in the relationship when we chatted on social media, and that reflected when we met, too,” says Pooja.\\n\\n\\nAnother Mumbaikar, Tanya Chopra connected with Rahul Sharma on a dating app. She never knew that she would end up marrying the guy. “I connected with Rahul in 2014. I was speaking to another guy at the same time and had spoken to a couple of them before as well. After a point, the conversation gets boring with the repeated questions, like ‘How are you?’ and ‘What are your hobbies?’ It’s the same drill. But with Rahul, it was different. He didn’t start the conversation with the usual. He asked me what my political views were, what I am like as a person. His knowledge and intelligence intrigued me and made me want to know him more,” she says.\\n\\n\\nDon’t play around\\nIt’s important to stay patient and not play around with sentiments on social networking sites if you want to find a true relationship. “When you start a relationship online, you have doubts. I was skeptical when Rahul and I started talking, because some men I connected with offered to meet me in my building at midnight after a 5-minute conversation. There were some who asked for my personal number a few seconds after connecting on social media. But Rahul did none of this. He gave me the time to get comfortable talking to him and opening up to him. We developed a strong bond and trust, and now, we are married,” says Tanya.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIf your areas of interest are common and your wavelengths match, striking a bond isn’t difficult. City-based celebrity manager Mona Jaswani found one of her closest friends four years ago on a photo-sharing social network. They bonded over their common spiritual beliefs. “We connected over spirituality, something which is quite unconventional when it comes to the younger generation. After knowing each other for a while, we realised that both of us were looking for a companion to connect with on the spiritual front. We didn’t exchange numbers and continued to chat on the site for months. The first time he invited me to meet was at a satsang (prayer meeting). I was surprised. We started going on walks and the topics we discussed included Lord Shiva, work and fitness,” she says.',\n",

    " \"At 55, Aasif Sheikh is in an enviable position. While many of his peers have either been relegated to doing insignificant roles, or faded into oblivion, the actor has managed to stay relevant. Defying the norm of younger faces playing heroes on TV, Aasif is the lead on the show, 'Bhabiji Ghar Par Hai!'\\nHe says, “The show has given me a new lease of life. Usually, an actor my age makes peace with the fact that he would be reduced to playing just papa and chacha on screen. I was also losing hope and had in a way prepared myself to wear the usual kurta pajama and stand behind an array of actors. However, I would still pray to God for that one opportunity where I had the scope to perform. A meaty role like Vibhuti’s (his character in 'Bhabiji...') is unthinkable. My life revolves around this show. I reach home after the shoot, spend an hour with my family over dinner, hit the bed and go back to work the next day. But they all understand that it is worth the effort.”\\n\\nHe adds, “My kids tell me to take it easy and slow down because I am 55 and yet running around. I tell them that I can’t. Jo kabhi zindagi mein nahi mila hai, woh ab mil raha hai. How can I slow down now? I have earned name, fame and money through this show. I will act till the time I can remember my lines.”\\n\\nBesides Vibhuti, Aasif has played over 250 characters and around 20 variations of a woman on the show. It’s the variety in the role that keeps him on his toes. He says, “Among other female characters, I have played Amrapali and a Chinese woman. After 1,200 episodes, there isn’t much left in the story to explore, so, we explore the characters. It’s always funny to see a man transform into a woman and I look good as a woman (laughs!). I have all shapes and sizes of clothes required to become a woman stored in my make-up room. In fact, my wife inquired about the eight pairs of sandals in my room when she visited the set once and I told her that they belonged to me. She was scandalised. I can play the quintessential heroine for a few episodes on a daily soap (laughs!). It takes me around four hours to dress like a woman, as I am very particular about my look. I sit with the team to finalise the look of the character I am playing.”\\n\\n\\nThe actor featured as a hero in films like 'Rama O Rama' (1988) and 'Yaara Dildara' (1991) and then hit a low. But he has no regrets over the slow phase in his career. He shares, “I like to move on and not regret anything in life. I started as a hero and did a few films, but there was no work for a few years. I played negative characters and bagged a role in 'Karan Arjun' (1995), which changed my life for the better. Life is a journey and I like to enjoy it. Earlier, I was seen as a decent performer, but this show has put me on a pedestal. It’s an overwhelming feeling. I am proud of what I am doing at this age. Ab return mil raha hai saalon ke hard work ka.”\\n\\n\\nWhile several youngsters prefer to take up finite shows after a long stint on a daily soap, Aasif says, “The idea to leave Bhabiji... has never crossed my mind. Finite or infinite, actors need to understand that they are playing characters on TV. It’s up to them to keep themselves amused and immersed in the character. I have been doing that since four years.”\\n\\n\\nThe show hit a roadblock when Shilpa Shinde, the original Angoori bhabhi, decided to quit the show three years ago. Aasif says, “I was the one who recommended Shilpa for that role. I had worked with her for a month on 'Chidiyaghar' and believed that she fit the bill. It was indeed a difficult time when she quit the show. But let me tell you, no one is indispensable on TV. The show will go on, maybe, the number of eyeballs will decrease. Things became alright after Shubhangi Atre joined as the new Angoori bhabhi. I feel the content makes a show and not just one character. Logon ke saath saath Shilpa ki bhi galat fehmi thi ki ek character show ko chalaata hai. She even told me, ‘I am the one who runs the show. Mere jaane ke baad show dekhna band ho jayega’. I told her that it was her biggest mistake to think like that. I am assuming she was being misguided by people. Of course, she was the most popular character on the show and her exit hit us. It took us around four months to recover.”\",\n",

    " 'Only three weeks back, everything seemed normal. Dipen Mitra, the proprietor of Mitra cinema — an iconic theatre in north Kolkata — turned up in crisp white dhoti-kurta and wore a smile to greet a motley group of movie lovers. He offered a platter of korapaaker sandesh and said it would be a huge loss for those who didn’t savour them. He showed rare pictures of old Kolkata and reminisced the golden era of Bengali cinema. Though he didn’t speak of his decision to close the theatre that day, he did say he was concerned about what would happen to it after he’s gone. The theatre, which was earlier known as Chitra cinema, changed hands and began its journey as Mitra in 1963. After decades of running movies of Satyajit Ray, Mrinal Sen, Ritwik Ghatak and many contemporaries, it downed shutters at the beginning of the month. With it, more single screens seem to be staring at a bleak future. In a brief chat, Dipen Mitra talks about his decision that has proved how April is indeed the cruellest month. Excerpts:\\nWhat made you decide to down shutters?\\n\\nAs we speak, I’m sitting at a hospital for a check-up. I’ve been ailing for quite some time now and didn’t want to pass my burden onto others. When people ask me, ‘How are you doing Dipenda?’, I tell them, ‘First class!’ But I’ve developed quite a few problems. I invested `20 lakh recently to renovate the theatre, but health issues started cropping up one after the other.\\nWhat about your family?\\n\\nI asked my sister-in-law about the problem. She too isn’t keeping well and can’t walk much. Then I asked my nephew if he would take responsibility of the theatre. My mother didn’t get me married. I had told her many times that fix a match for me, but that never happened (laughs). But she left me without foreseeing this future. Jokes apart, I asked my nephew, who is a chartered accountant and lives in Gurgaon. He has a demanding job and he clearly told me neither could he shift here nor did the family business interest him. He said he would ask a legal firm to look into the matter. What I realised after talking to them was that my employees would incur great losses if they took charge. I called my employees and asked them, ‘Tora ki korbi bol?’ They said they were ready to sign legal papers should I ask them to. I spoke to the lawyers and drafted an MoU. I summoned an employee and asked him to read it out to the rest. ‘Tui toh porashona korechhish, pore shona,’ I told him. He said if I’d read it, they had no problems with it. They left the papers on my table. I’ve cleared all their dues. They said, ‘Sir, apni ki korben?’ They are worried about me. Frankly, if anyone wants to run this theatre, I’d be more than happy.\\n\\nWhat do you plan to do with the theatre?\\n\\nAs of now, I don’t know. My nephew has asked me to sell it off. I am 75. At this age, I’m not getting married and I don’t need to worry about my wife or kids! My brother passed away at an early age. All I have is my sister-in-law, nephew and his family.\\n\\nWill you from now on lead a retired life?\\n\\nI was never into any service, so there’s no question of retirement. I have nothing to gain or lose. About what I’ll do in future, only time will tell. See, my idea was never to close this theatre. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have spent a huge amount on changing the transformer and upgrading the sound system. Only this morning, the air-conditioner maintenance person turned up at my door. Till I’m alive, I’ll keep maintaining the building. I am worried about my employees.\\n\\nWhat was the last running film?\\n\\nKesari. A lot of people are writing on social media that Mitra is turning into a mall, but fact is, I haven’t sold the theatre yet. These days, rumours spread very fast. Someone asked me why I was going to a hospital in the morning and said he would fix up an appointment with a cardiac surgeon. I said I don’t have a heart problem. I don’t know why people can’t let others be!\\n\\nFilm frat mourns the closing of iconic theatre\\n\\n‘Single screens are losing out to plexes in Kolkata’\\n\\nDipenda’s character is akin to the one I showed in Cinemawala. I, in fact, used his trophies in the film. I share a long association with him. When my first film, Waarish, released, he had come for its private screening at a south Kolkata theatre. He was so moved that he blessed me for the film. I’ve been to his theatre for many films. Nagarkirtan was running there recently and I visited the theatre after Drishtikone’s release last year. Every time I went there, he would treat me to cutlets. Fact is, single screens are losing out to plexes in Kolkata. They can’t give the wholesome experiences that plexes can now give — there’s no window-shopping involved and it doesn’t give you the false feeling of a Singapore trip.

About this year, I’m not too sure. He is a khandaani businessman and this news came as a big blow.

The first time I got involved with distribution was when Rituparno Ghosh made Unishe April. I knew the film could not be accommodated in Mitra and the team was heartbroken. Some of my films like Sudhu Tumi and Cross Connection have run there. I’d often visit the place and tell Dipenda, ‘Get married now.’ It’s such a theatre where Mon Janena can run, much like Cross Connection or Haami. So, it’s a mixed audience. For me, it’d be a reality check every time I went there. Dipenda doesn’t mince words and he’d tell me where a film stood. This is a huge blow for Bengali cinema.\\n\\n— Sudeshna Roy, filmmaker\\n\\n\\n‘I don’t know what is the reason behind this’\\n\\nIt’s a big loss for the film industry.

I am hoping the authorities will have a dialogue and work towards resolving this deadlock.\\n\\n— Prosenjit Chatterjee, actor',\n",
    " 'In 2006, a beautiful 23-year-old Pragya Prasun was subjected to her worst nightmare. Barely 10 days after she got married, a jilted lover threw acid on her face. Ever since, her life has been about accepting the truth and trying to move ahead. Now, 35-year-old Pragya, who recently won the Nari Shakti Puraskar — the highest civilian award given to women in India — talks to us about her journey from a meek and conflicted acid attack victim to a survivor and a beacon of hope for many.\\n‘My foundation was born out of my greatest sorrow’\\nHer struggle with burns and rehabilitation made Pragya rethink her life goals. “I was lucky to be from an educated and a financially-stable family, who asked the right questions. But while I was undergoing treatment in hospital, I saw a lot of burn victims, who were losing hope, as there was no one to guide them. So, I decided to help them. I started guiding them to the right doctor and giving them information about their diet and the treatments for scars,” she says. In a bid to help burn victims ask the right question and seek help at the right places, Pragya started an NGO, which has rehabilitated more than 200 acid attack victims across the country. From guiding patients to conducting burn camps, where nearly 25 surgeries for burns patients across the country are done in 3-4 days, her foundation (started in 2013) has come a long way. “Other than that, we get surgeries done for the patients one by one or in a group of 2-3 patients throughout the year in Bengaluru, Chennai, Delhi and Mumbai. The surgery count goes up till 3-4 each month. For four years, we have also been getting laser treatment and hair transplant done for 1-2 patients every month,” she adds.\\n\\n‘I tried to push my husband away’\\nWith 47% burns and hypertrophic scars all over, it was anything but easy going for Pragya after the attack. “I was a newly-married woman and barely 12 days into my marital life when I was attacked. To look at myself like that in the mirror impacted me deeply. I thought that my marriage would not sustain, as the first three years were difficult. I felt guilty about messing up my husband’s life and I tried to push him away. But he has been very supportive and has taken good care of me,” says Pragya. “I had suffered two miscarriages and was not in a good mind space, but after my first daughter was born in 2009, my life changed. She was the positivity in my life,” she says.\\n\\n‘It is definitely not easy for my daughter’\\n\\nBut even with a positive family, all has not been rosy for Pragya or her two daughters, as society has been harsh on them. “It used to be extremely difficult to just take my daughters to the playground or drop them at school, as parents would look away from us and even pull their children away. At school, my daughters are asked, ‘Why does your mother look like a ghost?’ But both my daughters are now strong and have developed coping skills,”\\n\\nsays Pragya, who feels that society is yet to become more accepting of acid attack victims.\\n\\n\\n‘Hope Chappak makes people more accepting of acid attack survivors’\\n\\nThis is why Pragya hopes that Deepika Padukone’s film with Meghna Gulzar, titled Chappak, is a changemaker. Chappak is based on an acid attack survivor. “I am glad that Deepika and a seasoned director like Meghna Gulzar have picked the issue of acid attacks as a subject for their film. I was amazed to see the first look. At the same time, I lament that the makeup Deepika wore for the movie is an everyday reality for many like me. I\\n\\nsincerely hope that the way people accept her in the movie is how they accept real-life survivors. I hope that the awareness this creates highlights the menace of acid attack in the society and is, therefore, eradicated from our world forever.”',\n",
    " 'What should have been a regular gig on Saturday night for Bengaluru-based stand-up comic Akshay Laxman at a city hot spot turned out to be quite the nightmare for him. “I was the last act that evening and there were a couple of disgruntled audience members who wanted some of the earlier comics to apologise for a few jokes. When it didn’t happen, one of them flung a beer mug at me,” Akshay recalls, adding that he is set to file a complaint against the offender. “This was a night that came with a prior warning. It was called Undressed Comedy and the guests knew that there would be some sexually explicit jokes. Through the course of the night, there were some jokes that centred on pedophilia,” explains Akshay.\\n\\nAkshay adds. “I guess the jokes got the better of them and since I was the last act, they tried to ask for some kind of an apology, but seeing none coming, the mug was hurled at me in frustration.”\\n\\nThe incident was shared by Akshay on his Facebook page, which was how many other comics heard of it and then condemned the act. Sanjay Manaktala points out, “It is not uncommon for someone to take offence to jokes. But the best feedback in comedy is laughter and these guys could have kept quiet. Inciting violence is definitely not right. And the people who are being accused here are definitely not uneducated. I have seen a similar incident once. I was waiting for my turn for a show in Singapore, where there was another person on stage before me. He was making fun of Australians and their drinking habits, when one of the members took offence and threw a beer bottle. The audience member, luckily for me, was taken out before I went on stage. But at such shows, it is hard to know when someone is offended and how they would react.”\\n\\nDanish Sait, too, adds that this incident is unacceptable. “People need to stop being righteous. When they have gone to a night that has stand-up comedy, they understand that comedy is a heightened state of a regular situation. If one doesn’t agree to the jokes, the best is to get up and leave. Just because one has paid, no one will dance to your tunes. A comic usually prepares a set of jokes that he likes. Hecklers, who are just trolls from the online world in real life, are always around,” he adds.\\n\\nBut how does one learn to handle these hecklers? “It takes a lot of practice. I have seen a lot of senior comics like Sorabh Pant go from ignoring to addressing them to now just asking them to shut up and not ruin the show,” says Danish. Sanjay adds, “Another thing most comics end up doing is building their own network. All of us have friends in the legal sector and other corporate bodies.”',\n",

    " 'After creating music together for almost a decade and tasting success with songs like Saara Zamana (Kaabil) and Hawa Hawa (Total Dhamaal), music duo Gourov-Roshin say that today remixes work because everyone asks for them. We spoke to Gourov Dasgupta, who was in Bengaluru recently, about his love for the city, indie artistes and more. Excerpts:\\nBengaluru’s music scene has changed over the years\\nWhen I used to live in Bengaluru, rock music was at its best. I had come down to the city to watch Iron Maiden perform live. A lot has changed now, though. But that’s the case everywhere. DJs have taken over and people like chill-out music and proper musicians have slowly ventured in to the film industry or are composing for advertisements, because there’s no other way to survive. I have performed at several music\\n\\nfestivals in Bengaluru, and that’s when one could experience the city’s love for music.\\n\\nWorking on remixes is a challenge\\n\\nGourov, who recently tasted success with Total Dhamaal, says that remixing a classic requires a lot of work. “It’s extremely challenging because, no matter how hard you work, a certain section will always criticise you and compare it with the original, whereas some will be happy with it. Honestly, as musicians, we would not want to do recreations. I think that’s a global sentiment. But recreations seem to be working because, every record label and every producer wants them. There is something that seems to be clicking with the audience. Probably, the younger generation hasn’t heard the original version and they are enjoying the rehashed version,” says Gourov, adding that, as composers, they try to add their style to any recreation they work on. “Everyone wants to work on original compositions but, sometimes we don’t have a choice. If a record label says that they want this particular thing, one has to do it or else someone else will do it,” says Gourov. But doesn’t that curtail the freedom of a music composer? “It does. But you need to be in a position to decide a lot of things. Thankfully, we are able to strike a balance,” adds Gourov.\\n\\n\\nIndie artists are getting more exposure today\\n\\nUnlike earlier, indie artistes today are performing several gigs, says Gourov. “Things are getting better for indie artistes. There are many pop rock bands and other indie acts that are doing well today, but rock music in particular, I’m not sure of. There are so many of them performing at big venues,” he sums up.',\n",

Vivek Simha, who plays her romantic interest in the film, chips in, “When I heard that I was to play Jaggesh sir’s son, I was very nervous.

    " 'Only three weeks back, everything seemed normal. Dipen Mitra, the proprietor of Mitra cinema — an iconic theatre in north Kolkata — turned up in crisp white dhoti-kurta and wore a smile to greet a motley group of movie lovers. He offered a platter of korapaaker sandesh and said it would be a huge loss for those who didn’t savour them. He showed rare pictures of old Kolkata and reminisced the golden era of Bengali cinema. Though he didn’t speak of his decision to close the theatre that day, he did say he was concerned about what would happen to it after he’s gone. The theatre, which was earlier known as Chitra cinema, changed hands and began its journey as Mitra in 1963. After decades of running movies of Satyajit Ray, Mrinal Sen, Ritwik Ghatak and many contemporaries, it downed shutters at the beginning of the month. With it, more single screens seem to be staring at a bleak future. In a brief chat, Dipen Mitra talks about his decision that has proved how April is indeed the cruellest month. Excerpts:\\nWhat made you decide to down shutters?\\n\\nAs we speak, I’m sitting at a hospital for a check-up. I’ve been ailing for quite some time now and didn’t want to pass my burden onto others. When people ask me, ‘How are you doing Dipenda?’, I tell them, ‘First class!’ But I’ve developed quite a few problems. I invested `20 lakh recently to renovate the theatre, but health issues started cropping up one after the other.\\nWhat about your family?\\n\\nI asked my sister-in-law about the problem. She too isn’t keeping well and can’t walk much. Then I asked my nephew if he would take responsibility of the theatre. My mother didn’t get me married. I had told her many times that fix a match for me, but that never happened (laughs). But she left me without foreseeing this future. Jokes apart, I asked my nephew, who is a chartered accountant and lives in Gurgaon. He has a demanding job and he clearly told me neither could he shift here nor did the family business interest him. He said he would ask a legal firm to look into the matter. What I realised after talking to them was that my employees would incur great losses if they took charge. I called my employees and asked them, ‘Tora ki korbi bol?’ They said they were ready to sign legal papers should I ask them to. I spoke to the lawyers and drafted an MoU.

Honestly, as musicians, we would not want to do recreations. I think that’s a global sentiment. But recreations seem to be working because, every record label and every producer wants them. There is something that seems to be clicking with the audience. Probably, the younger generation hasn’t heard the original version and they are enjoying the rehashed version,” says Gourov, adding that, as composers, they try to add their style to any recreation they work on. “Everyone wants to work on original compositions but, sometimes we don’t have a choice. If a record label says that they want this particular thing, one has to do it or else someone else will do it,” says Gourov. But doesn’t that curtail the freedom of a music composer? “It does. But you need to be in a position to decide a lot of things. Thankfully, we are able to strike a balance,” adds Gourov.\\n\\n\\nIndie artists are getting more exposure today\\n\\nUnlike earlier, indie artistes today are performing several gigs, says Gourov. “Things are getting better for indie artistes. There are many pop rock bands and other indie acts that are doing well today, but rock music in particular, I’m not sure of. There are so many of them performing at big venues,” he sums up.',\n",

This time around, he will be acting in Caarthick Raju’s Kannaadi, which stars Sundeep Kishan and Anya Singh in the lead. Joining him is Malavika Nair, who wowed the audience with her performance in Cuckoo.\\n\\nConfirming the news, Sundeep, who’s acted in Karthick’s Naragasooran, says, “Karthick and I are good friends, and when we wanted someone young for this role, we thought he’d fit the bill. We’ve been bonding so much now; in fact, I’ve been shopping for his costumes!”\\n\\n\\nHe adds, “Malavika is a great performer, and she is also very choosy about her roles.

    " 'In today’s day and age where body-shaming has become a matter of concern, millennials are taking their fitness seriously. With different exercising techniques and diets, college students are fitter than ever and leave no stone unturned to look and feel their best.\\nHitting the gym and indulging in sporting activities\\nFor many city students, hitting the gym on a daily basis is a must and this is due to various reasons. “I go to the gym daily and spend at least two hours in there. I was into sports when I was in school and once I came to college, I didn’t want to lose touch with my physical activities. So, I began hitting the gym. In addition to this, I run as well,” says Tarun Kumar, a student of Presidency University. Students don’t just hit the gym, but do exercises depending on their strengths and their goals. “I like to lift weights. I was doing functional training, but realised that I couldn’t do a handstand. I was also losing a lot of weight because I wasn’t eating right. That’s when I stopped functional training and started lifting weights and saw the difference,” says Greeshma Ramesh, a student of St. Joseph’s College of Commerce, who hits the gym six days a week. Today, students love to experiment with different exercising techniques. “I indulge in different forms of workouts like power yoga, aerobics, Tabata and more,” says Preksha Vijay, a student of Nitte Meenakshi Institute of Technology.\\n\\n\\nDiet plays a crucial role\\n\\nIf you exercise regularly, but don’t follow a diet, it doesn’t serve the purpose, say students, which is why they too follow a strict diet based on their exercise routine. “Diet is a very important aspect of one’s fitness regime. For example, other than hitting the gym, I follow intermittent fasting with a keto diet. Keto requires you to replace carbs with fat. Intermittent fasting is where one fasts for 16 hours and consumes meals in the eight hour window,” says Preksha.\\n\\nBut following a diet is not easy and cheat days too are done keeping in mind the repercussions. “People say that most of your fitness regime is mostly 30% workout and 70% diet. So yes, diet is important, especially when you’re building muscles. I consume calorie-surplus food and make sure that I consume a particular amount of calories every day,” says Tarun, adding that chicken, eggs and other natural proteins are included in his diet on a daily basis. “Following a diet is hard because calories matter and it’s not easy. Even when I have a cheat day, it has to be calories-based. I cannot go overboard. My diet is specific; I consume brown rice, brown bread and chicken breast, in addition to other things,” says Greeshma.\\n\\n\\nExercising doesn’t come cheap\\n\\nGym subscriptions and following diets are a costly affair and students spend anywhere between `7,000 to `10,000 a month for this. “Along with training fees, protein shakes and supplements, my every month expenditure on my fitness routine is approximately `7,000,” says Preksha. Similarly, Greeshma says that since she follows a strict diet, it does cost her a lot every month. “Since protein powders are expensive, the overall cost of my fitness regime automatically goes up. Since I like having chicken and eggs every day, my per month expenses are anywhere between `5,000 and 7,000,” Greeshma sums up.',\n",

    " 'Actress and kathak dancer Prachee Shah Paandya known for her roles in serials like \\'Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi\\', \\'Iss Pyaar Ko Kya Naam Doon..Ek Baar Phir\\' and more was in Lucknow recently for an event. The actress, who was part of the film \\'Mulk\\' which was shot extensively in Lucknow, says that Lucknow somehow brings out her artistic personality. \"I shot for \\'Mulk\\' which was for around 21 days and starting from having nawabi cuisines on set to chikan shopping, everything was just amazing, I really enjoyed myself. I feel that Lucknow actually brings out the artist in me. Of course, my journey started with Lucknow and Jaipur where I used to come and do stage shows. I feel that somewhere, Lucknow se mera pichhle janm ka naata hai. It has a great vibe and I love wearing chikan suits. I think, given a choice for 365 days I can wear chikan suits and saris. I am not a jeans and a western attire person, so I am happy wearing a chikan kurta and sharara which I think suits me the best. I love the whole feel of the place.\" The kathak danseuse and actress who recently lost her guru Ganesh Hiralal ji, of the seventh generation of the Hiralal family of the Jaipur gharana, feels that she has not just lost her guru but someone who taught her to live through dance. Talking about it and getting emotional at the same time, Prachee says, \"The emotions are coming out in bouts because this morning when I woke up I had no one to talk to. He was 82 and for two years he had congestion in his chest. Who would have thought that one day I would wake up and not find him around me. He was someone who was more of a father figure rather than a guru.\"\\n\\nPrachee with her guru late Ganesh Hiralalji (BCCL/ Aditya Yadav)\\n\\nShe adds, \"I haven’t lost a guru, I have lost my soul! I have learnt kathak for about 25 years and maine hamesha se one-on-one seekha hai. I have not attended any class so that bond was even more special. He was 82-years-old and one would not believe that he had performed on vocal padhanth with me till last year in all major festivals whether in India or abroad. So the thought that he is not around is still difficult for me to take in. My father and my husband were there during the funeral ceremony and they kept on sending me pictures, and I was crying continuously. I still can’t imagine that I have lost him because he is somebody who moulded me as a human being right from the way I project myself, the way I dress up and the way I talk. Unka hamesha se kehna tha ki ‘kaam bolna chahiye’, he never believed in outer appearances.\" Adding, she says, \"The moment you are on stage whether it is for three hours or three minutes, it’s your entry that says it all. These were his words. The only strength I get while I am on stage is the fact that he is there with me on stage who can easily handle my flaws. And despite being a guru, he never overpowered me on stage. He said that ‘this is your stage, you make the laye, you make the rhythm, you conduct the show and I am there to guide you’. I mean which guru does that? I feel that I am thoroughly blessed to have him in his life. It’s been 25 years and all major festivals in the country or abroad, I have travelled everywhere with him and not once did he say ki ‘main thak gaya hoon ya mujhse nahi hoga’. He was the simplest man who was happy having daal, chawal, roti, sabzi and ice cream was his favourite dessert.\"\\n\\nPrachee Shah Paandya (BCCL/ Aditya Yadav)\\n\\n\"Now I really don’t know how will I be on stage, the fact that he will not be present to teach me and guide me is frightening. All these years he has seen me enter into the phase of a wife to a mother and been there when I was expecting my first child. The entire spiritual aspect in me is totally because of him because he was so spiritual,\" adds the actress who has also done films like Judwaa 2 and Student of The Year. The actress shares that the transition from television to film has been more difficult for her. Talking about her role in Mulk, Prachee says the film gave her a strong recognition in the film fraternity. \"I have been a part of television for more than 20 years so to kind of give you a breakthrough in films with a performance oriented role, I think Mulk has kind of started it for me. And now I can hope to do better films. I have done a complete commercial film like \\'Judwaa 2\\' with David Dhawan ji, which sometimes amazes me ki I have done that film. I fall in such an age group where I neither look 45-50 years old nor 25-30. That is a reason I get to play the roles of mother and I believe playing a mother has a more wide range to it and a longer run career wise. So I am happy I got to do a film like Mulk which challenged me as an actor,\" says Prachee, who says she would love to experiment more with such roles.\\n\\n— Prachi Arya',\n",
    " 'It cannot get bigger than this. “I am not going to answer any questions on the plot of Endgame. It took me three years to protect it from Tom Holland and Mark Ruffalo, so I am not going to suddenly give it away,” jokes American filmmaker Joe Russo, of the Russo brothers, co-director of the year’s, perhaps, the decade’s most awaited superhero film — Avengers: Endgame, in a candid chat. This is his fourth Marvel film and the twenty-second film in the entirety of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). In Mumbai, to kick-start the film’s promotions, Joe spoke to Bombay Times on Indian influences in the Marvel series, his comic-book fixation, Stan Lee, Robert Downey Jr (RDJ) being nothing like Tony Stark, need for diversity, longevity of superhero films and more.\\nThis is your first visit to India. Take us through your experience so far.\\nI have never been here before, so I came with an open mind. I am ecstatic. One of the real values of getting to work on these films is that you get to travel across the globe and interact with people from different cultures. I am a big fan of telling my children that their job in life is to collect as many fascinating experiences as they can. Part of that is travelling, cultural experiences, understanding the world and becoming a\\n\\nglobal citizen. It’s really meaningful for me to get my family here.\\n\\n\\nAre you familiar with Indian cinema?\\nI have seen a few Indian films like Dabangg. I think Indian audiences will love the fact that Robot/Enthiran (S Shankar’s 2010 bilingual starring Rajinikanth) was almost a big influence on Avengers: Age of Ultron, 2015 (directed by Joss Whedon). There is a sequence in Robot, where all the robots come together to form a giant snake. In the Avengers movie, there was a bunch of Ultrons, who come together to form a giant Ultron. The scene was eventually cut for time, but that was a direct influence from Robot.\\n\\nYou have made four Marvel films in the past six years. What do you think is integral to the future of superhero films?\\nThe more diverse they get, the more interesting they become. Everyone has a right to see themselves on screen. Audiences become more passionate, when storytellers get more inclusive. The next phase of Marvel movies will get more diverse. Look at the success of Black Panther and Captain Marvel. The new crop of stories will have more pure global influence.\\n\\n\\nDuring an interview Tom Hanks told us that because of the rich technology and CGI, superhero films are living up to the promise of comic books. But eventually, the tide will turn. The stories that always remain with you are the ones showing human condition.\\nThese (superhero films) are human stories! They are highly relatable characters. Listen, I think that if it’s not your cup of tea, you tend to shutout. For a whole global generation of film goers, these movies have become very important. They are a part of their growing up years and pop culture. The best of these movies tell compelling stories about humans, who happen to have powers. The powers are secondary to the experiences of characters as people and the choices that they make. I think the best of these movies have incredible thematics in them. I don’t necessarily think you can call superhero films a fad, when it has this kind of global reach. I think you just have to respect the fact the audience finds a lot in these films to inspire and connect them.\\n\\nSpeaking of #Whateverittakes (the punchline of Endgame), what does it take for you and Anthony (the other Russo brother co-directing the film) to work with so many superstars on one film?\\nIt takes a lot (smiles!). It’s been a great experience for us. We have been very fortunate that this cast is incredible. Look, Oscar winners show up just to do one day’s work for your film, so you are spoilt as a filmmaker with the love of your cast.\\n\\nYou hear things like Robert Downey Jr wanting multiple vanity vans. He even jokes about it. He seems like a diva. Is he like that for real?\\nHe jokes about it (laughs!), but you know why he does that? I think it is to play along and create a persona. He acts like a diva, but he is actually the hardest working actor you will ever work with. He is exceedingly professional. There is a reason why he is one of the biggest movie stars in the world. The energy and effort he puts into his work every second and the way he approaches his character and believes what it is, the way he shows up on set everyday, the level of intensity he brings to his work ethic — it’s commendable. Even when he promotes his films... that requires a lot of effort. He has a certain effervescence about him that’s universally translated and it comes at a cost. It requires him to project himself a certain way.\\n\\nTony Stark feels like RDJ’s alter ego, Chris Hemsworth exudes Thor’s confidence in his physical strength... it’s amazing how these characters seem like they are based on the actors that play them.\\nIt’s interchangeable, isn’t it? You want the actors to have an emotional connect with the characters they play. When you really get to know Robert, you discover that he is nothing like Tony Stark. He has a public persona that he slips into, which is like Tony but when you have an intimate conversation with him, you realise he is very different. He is warm, genuine and generous human being. Chris Evans relates to one of the important people from his childhood. He based Captain America’s performance on this man he knew, so that’s very personal. They all find a certain sense of themselves in these characters after playing them for so long.\\n\\nIs this Chris Evans’ last film as Captain America? He had hinted about it.\\nChris Evans said this is his last film? I don’t know what he has been drinking (smiles). Impossible to say, anything can happen. This is the Marvel Universe. I won’t give away the plot, except that Infinity War was told from the point of view of Thanos and this one is not.\\n\\nIt was heartbreaking to see Loki being killed in Infinity War.\\nA lot of people are upset about that but all good things come to an end.\\n\\nSpeaking of fiercely guarding the plot, is it true that Tom Holland doesn’t get the script because he can’t keep secrets?\\nYes, he doesn’t (smiles). He just gets his lines and that’s it. He is not even told who he is acting opposite of. We use vague terms to describe to him what’s happening. He has a difficult time keeping his mouth shut (laughs).\\n\\n\\n\\nThe legendary Stan Lee is no longer with us. It won’t be the same without him, isn’t it?\\nI wouldn’t be where I am today if it wasn’t for Stan Lee. I grew up on his comic books since I was 10, he is my idol. I believe that his final cameo is in this film. To get an opportunity to not only work on the material that he created, but to be able to work with him was a dream come true.\\n\\nWhat are the pros and cons of co-directing with your brother Anthony, being part of a joint venture?\\nThe pros are the fact that we have been able to make four Marvel movies in the last six years without dropping dead. There are no cons. Of course there are conflicts. We are always arguing and that makes this process successful. We challenge every idea that comes to the table and the best idea wins. It’s about maintaining the right balance between pushing against each other and backing off. Out of that comes a chemistry that creates these movies.\\n\\nThe superheroes abstain from sex. There was an interesting article on this that recently went viral.\\nNo sex in Avengers movies? There was a bedroom scene in Infinity War, which implied that. But I think it is about the demographics. These movies need to translate with the children as well as they do gravitate towards these movies. The whole family should be able to enjoy these films without having to put hands on their children’s eyes. At the core, the characters are human and their psychology has been the focus more than their sexuality I guess.\\n\\nWhat’s next for you in the MCU?\\n\\nEleven years of storytelling, nine franchises and 22 movies culminate into this film. Now, I want to take a little break. We have made four films in six years. You need to find the right stories to be able to reach the audience on this scale. It has been an enriching experience for us.\\n\\n\\nEndgame is the longest Marvel film till date?\\n\\nIt’s 3 hours and 2 minutes. It’s 11 years of narrative culminating into one movie. We are focusing on the original six avengers and closing the book on those characters so a lot of thought went into creating a powerful ending. We just couldn’t get the duration down. It’s a lot of storytelling with lot of characters. No one has ever done even remotely anything like this. A lot of characters in Infinity War are staggering. It requires a lot of disciple and focus to create moments that validate the existence of those characters in that story. Endgame is wrapping up all of this so we knew it will never be under three hours.\\n\\n\\nWhile DC has had an inconsistent run at the box office. Marvel keeps churning blockbusters time and again. What is the secret?\\n\\nMarvel does this amazing job of picking people who care about these films and find immense joy in making them. Be it James Gunn, Ryan Coogler or my brother and myself. I have been collecting comic books since I was 10 years old. Being comic book geeks means you understand the methodology behind the characters. You understand the archetype and values they represent. The audience values the subtleties you bring to the table.',\n",

While everything was seemingly fine between them, it was recently reported that Prateek has moved on and is now dating Reyhna Pandit, who plays the antagonist on 'Manmohini', which he was directing till some time ago.

Whether we are together or not is entirely our call. What I can say for sure is that there is no third party involved in this situation. No one has ever created a rift between us, and to set the record straight, I am not dating Reyhna.”\\n\\nHe added, “I get along with Reyhna and other team members of 'Manmohini', as we are all of the same age group. We had a lot of fun and enjoyed our time together during the shoot. I am friends with a lot of girls, and that doesn’t mean I am dating all of them. In fact, even Reyhna was aghast to hear these stories. The truth is, I have already moved on to the next project and hardly visit the set of 'Manmohini' these days. Just because I mingle well with people, it’s easy to link me with girls my age. A good friendship shouldn’t always be looked upon as an affair.”\\n\\n\\nOn her part, Donal said, “I don’t want to talk about my personal life. I would like my work to be discussed, as I am completely focussed on it.” Despite repeated attempts, we couldn’t reach Reyhna for comment.\",\n",

We try to find one\\nLast Friday, those who were eagerly waiting to watch 'Hotel Mumbai' were surprised to see its shows suddenly go missing, even after the film’s worldwide release date was confirmed as March 29. Directed by Anthony Maras, and starring Anupam Kher, Dev Patel, Armie Hammer and Nazanin Boniadi, the film shows the experiences of the trapped hotel guests and staff as armed terrorists stormed the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel during the Mumbai terror attacks in 2008.\\nThe film’s team is staying mum on why it skipped its originally-scheduled India release, and the silence has led many distributors to speculate that the reason could be its “sensitive content”, while other industry insiders suspect that with the post-Pulwama tensions and upcoming elections, it was bad timing. But turns out, the reason behind the silence is, in fact, a legal deadlock.\\nSeparately, the film was pulled out of theatres in Australia and New Zealand after the mass shooting in Christchurch “out of respect for a country in mourning”, the film’s New Zealand distributor had said. But no official reason has been given for the film missing its India release.\\n\\n\\nWe have no information: Hotel Mumbai’s team Anupam Kher, who plays Head Chef Hemant Oberoi in the film, had tweeted that the film would release “nationwide” on March 29. But he hasn’t tweeted anything about its India release since, and did not reply to our queries.\\nJennifer Nguyen, publicist at Maxine Leonard PR, which is handling the marketing of the film, replied to an email query saying, “We do not have information to share at this time.”\\nHotel Mumbai is a Bleecker Street and ShivHans Pictures film. ShivHans Pictures did not respond to our queries, and Bleecker Street (a New York-based film distribution company) told us they did not have the international rights for the film. Multiple production companies like Electric Pictures, Arclight Films, Thunder Road Pictures and Xeitgeist Entertainment Group are linked with the film. Gaurav Mishra, MD and producer at Xeitgeist Entertainment Group, an Australia and Singapore-based production company, declined to discuss the film’s India release date with a standard “No comments” reply. Electric Pictures and Arclight Films did not respond to our queries.\\nTill last week, BookMyShow displayed the release date of the film as “March 29”, but it was later changed to “December 27, 2019”. Asked if the release was actually deferred to that date, and if they were given any reason for it, a BookMyShow executive declined to comment by pointing out that only the producers of the film could answer queries related to the film’s release. The portal has now dropped the date from the desktop version of its website, which now only says “December”.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe don’t know why the film has not released: Indian exhibitors\\nExhibitors say the last information they had about the film was its scheduled release date. However, the film’s team hasn’t contacted them since. Rajender Singh Jyala, Chief Programming Officer at Inox Leisure Limited, says, “We had information that the film was scheduled to release on March 29, but the distributors or the production house never got in touch with us for the release of the film on the date. So whether the film’s India release has been deferred or cancelled, we have no information.”\\nTinku Singh, SRS Cinemas, adds, “There’s a suspicious silence surrounding the reasons the film has missed its India release date. We never heard about any studio tie-ups with this film or that any Indian distributor has bought the film. But this is not rare. Sometimes, foreign films will tie up with Indian studios or exhibitors for release, but that wasn’t the case this time.”\\n\\nThe film has sensitive content, who will take the risk?: Local distributors\\nThe IMDB page of Hotel Mumbai lists all its distributors from several countries, but there’s no mention of India. Did the film not find any distributor in India? Shaaminder Mallik, a Delhi-based distributor, tells us, “The film was not released on the scheduled date because it couldn’t find any distributors in India. Indian distributors have their own apprehensions about a film which is also giving narrative space to terrorists.”\\nAnother Delhi-based distributor, without wishing to be named, tells us, “We are not sure of the exact reasons the film didn’t release, but our information is that no distributors bought the film because of the sensitive nature of the content. There were reports that the film also attempts to humanise the terrorists. Should the film be released in India in the current scenario? With elections next month, we didn’t want to take the risk of protests and vandalism in theatres. It’s a foreign production, and none of the distributors found it a profitable venture to invest their money and take that risk. In case of opposition to the film, who will bear the losses?”\\n\\nBookMyShow modified 'Hotel Mumbai’s release date from ‘29 March’ to ‘27 Dec’, but its desktop version later changed it to ‘Dec 2019’\\n\\n\\nTussle over who gets to release film lands in Bombay High Court\\nA few days ago, it was reported that Plus Holdings, a Dubai-based company, took Netflix Global, Hotel Mumbai PTY LTD, Arclight Films and Xeitgeist Entertainment Group to the Bombay High Court over who had the rights to release the film in the SAARC region. Plus Holdings claimed that they had the original rights, which they had bought from Xeitgeist Entertainment Group, and moved the Bombay HC to stop Netflix from releasing the film. Netflix has since informed the court that its rights to show Hotel Mumbai on its platform have been terminated by Hotel Mumbai PTY Ltd (HMPL). They then sought to be deleted as a respondent party in the suit which was accepted by the HC. When contacted, Netflix declined to comment, saying that the matter was sub judice. Sources close to Netflix confirmed to DT that they will not be releasing the film in India, and they have nothing to do with the film now. But even though Netflix is no longer associated with the film, Plus Holdings cannot release the film yet, according to the court order.\\nSandeep S Ladda, the lawyer representing Plus Holdings, told us their version of the case. We take you through the case step-by-step.\\nOver the dispute of distribution rights, Ladda filed a petition in the Bombay HC in February to stop Netflix from releasing the film in the SAARC territory. He claimed that Plus Holdings had bought the rights from Xeitgeist. The lawyer alleged that Xeitgeist then unlawfully transferred the movie’s rights to Netflix through a third party last year. However, it was revealed in court that “when the agreement was entered into between Plus Holdings and Xeitgeist, the SAARC distribution rights were held by Xeitgeist, but the agreement was later terminated and the distribution rights reverted to HMPL, the original owner of the film. Later, HMPL entered into an agreement with Netflix, which was also later terminated by HMPL.” Therefore, Xeitgeist contended that it was “powerless to stop HMPL or Netflix”.\\n\\nPlus Holdings’ lawyer appealed to the Bombay HC to stop Netflix from releasing the film, saying that they had exclusive rights to release the film in the Indian subcontinent. Plus Holdings asked the court to restrain Netflix, Xeitgeist, HMPL and other associated parties that it listed in its petition from claiming any rights to the film in India till the time an ongoing dispute between itself and Xeitgeist is being adjudicated upon by a Singapore arbitration court. In a hearing on March 7, the Bombay High Court restrained HMPL from entering into any agreement related to the movie Hotel Mumbai. The matter has now been adjourned till April 4.\\n\\nAs Xeitgeist refused to comment, and Hotel Mumbai’s team didn’t respond to our queries, we are unable to bring you their version.\\n\\n\\nWill the film release in India?\\n\\nThe petition was filed to stop Netflix from releasing Hotel Mumbai. Since Netflix is no longer associated with the film, will it release in India now? Turns out, it is not that simple.\\n\\nThe March 7 order of the Bombay HC states, “In such a situation, whether Xeitgeist at all had any rights to be assigned in favour of HMPL and whether it can be said that Xeitgeist would be legitimately entitled to any rights of exhibitions of the film in question for the SAARC countries would be required to be considered.” Also, the court order states that HMPL, to whom the rights of the film for SAARC were reverted post contract-cancellation, did not appear in the court on March 7, and as stated above, even though HMPL holds all the rights to the film, it has been restrained from “entering into any agreement” regarding the film.\\n\\nSources close to the case say that Plus Holdings will continue to seek to block the release of the movie in India through any other channel as it holds exclusive broadcasting and other rights. Ladda confirmed to us, “My client is ready and willing to exercise their rights to distribute the film in India as well in other countries as per contract.” However, he refused to respond if Plus Holdings is in talks with any Indian exhibitor or distributor for the release of the film.\\n\\nAmid the legal wrangling, it looks like India won’t get to watch a film on one of the most infamous terror attacks on its soil anytime soon, while it puts the spotlight on the attacks internationally.\",\n",
    " \"Actress Sonyaa, who is currently seen on the supernatural show, 'Nazar', has changed her surname. She felt that her original surname — Gupta — brought caste consciousness and hence, decided to drop it. The actress has now started using her late grandfather’s name, Ayodhya, as a tribute to him. Sonyaa says, “I feel that surname gives away not just your caste, but also your standing in the social order. Sometimes, it reflects a person’s economic status as well. I find it absurd. I don’t believe in anything that discriminates humans, be it religion or caste. I strongly feel that surname should not be used as a benchmark to check whether someone is superior or not. That’s why I decided to drop my surname.”\\n\\n\\nSince the last name is mandatory on social networking profiles, Sonyaa randomly entered Pink as her surname. This created a lot of confusion. “I added Pink on an impulse, but it resulted in a lot of confusion with people actually taking it as my surname,” she says, adding, “I never got to meet my grandparents and I don’t know much about them. So, as a tribute to my grandfather, I started using his name as my last name. It makes me feel connected to my roots. Now, I am Sonyaa Ayodhya.”\",\n",
    " 'Whether you’re a professional athlete, a fitness enthusiast, someone who enjoys exercising or wants to start working out to get in shape, the strength of your core is very important. Getting a chiseled core is not easy — it requires dedication and determination. Having said that, remember that every person is different, so what may work for someone else, may not for you, and vice versa. Here are five ab exercises that will help your achieve a strong core.\\nPartial sit up\\nStart by lying on your back and bending your knees. Keeping your arms straight, slowly raise them overhead and start to sit up halfway. Hold on for three seconds and return back to the original position. Repeat this at least 10 times.\\n\\n\\nSwiss ball crunch This may seem easy but is harder than it looks. Take a medium sized Swiss ball and lie back on the ball with your feet on the floor about shoulder-width apart. Make sure that your lower back is well supported. Now, place your hands at the back of your head, start to curl your body while slowly getting off the ball till you’re sitting up. Repeat this eight to 10 times.\\n\\nLeg raises\\n\\nLie down in front of a pole or a heavy piece of furniture. Hold the the pole just above your head and keep your legs straight. Now, lift them up until they’re completely vertical and slowly lower them back. Make sure you don’t touch your legs to the floor but bring them down just inches above it. Repeat this 10 to 12 times.\\n\\n\\nSide/ star plank\\n\\nBored doing the regular planks? Try the side plank, which is twice as challenging. Start by lying down on your right side and place your right forearm on the floor. Slowly raise your hips, keeping your shoulder, hips and ankles in a straight line, pulling your stomach in. Make sure that your right forearm and right foot are bearing your weight. Hold on for as long as you can and repeat on the other side.\\n\\nAnother effective plank exercise is the star plank where you need to get into a push-up position. Next, place your arms and legs are far apart as possible, so that your body looks like a star. Make sure your palms are flat on the floor and your weight is equally distributed. Hold on for 15 to 20 seconds and repeat twice.\\n\\n\\nSwiss Ball Plank Circle\\n\\nTake a Swiss ball and place it on the floor. Place your hands on it as if you’re getting into a push-up with your legs in a straight line behind you. Slowly lower your forearms while they are firmly placed on the ball, keeping yourself straight. Use your elbows and wrists to move the ball in a circular motion, both clockwise and counterclockwise. This exercise requires control so that you don’t lose your balance.',\n",

    " 'Only three weeks back, everything seemed normal. Dipen Mitra, the proprietor of Mitra cinema — an iconic theatre in north Kolkata — turned up in crisp white dhoti-kurta and wore a smile to greet a motley group of movie lovers. He offered a platter of korapaaker sandesh and said it would be a huge loss for those who didn’t savour them. He showed rare pictures of old Kolkata and reminisced the golden era of Bengali cinema. Though he didn’t speak of his decision to close the theatre that day, he did say he was concerned about what would happen to it after he’s gone. The theatre, which was earlier known as Chitra cinema, changed hands and began its journey as Mitra in 1963. After decades of running movies of Satyajit Ray, Mrinal Sen, Ritwik Ghatak and many contemporaries, it downed shutters at the beginning of the month. With it, more single screens seem to be staring at a bleak future. In a brief chat, Dipen Mitra talks about his decision that has proved how April is indeed the cruellest month. Excerpts:\\nWhat made you decide to down shutters?\\n\\nAs we speak, I’m sitting at a hospital for a check-up. I’ve been ailing for quite some time now and didn’t want to pass my burden onto others. When people ask me, ‘How are you doing Dipenda?’, I tell them, ‘First class!’ But I’ve developed quite a few problems. I invested `20 lakh recently to renovate the theatre, but health issues started cropping up one after the other.\\nWhat about your family?\\n\\nI asked my sister-in-law about the problem. She too isn’t keeping well and can’t walk much. Then I asked my nephew if he would take responsibility of the theatre. My mother didn’t get me married. I had told her many times that fix a match for me, but that never happened (laughs). But she left me without foreseeing this future. Jokes apart, I asked my nephew, who is a chartered accountant and lives in Gurgaon. He has a demanding job and he clearly told me neither could he shift here nor did the family business interest him. He said he would ask a legal firm to look into the matter. What I realised after talking to them was that my employees would incur great losses if they took charge. I called my employees and asked them, ‘Tora ki korbi bol?’ They said they were ready to sign legal papers should I ask them to. I spoke to the lawyers and drafted an MoU. I summoned an employee and asked him to read it out to the rest. ‘Tui toh porashona korechhish, pore shona,’ I told him. He said if I’d read it, they had no problems with it. They left the papers on my table. I’ve cleared all their dues. They said, ‘Sir, apni ki korben?’ They are worried about me. Frankly, if anyone wants to run this theatre, I’d be more than happy.\\n\\nWhat do you plan to do with the theatre?\\n\\nAs of now, I don’t know. My nephew has asked me to sell it off. I am 75. At this age, I’m not getting married and I don’t need to worry about my wife or kids! My brother passed away at an early age. All I have is my sister-in-law, nephew and his family.\\n\\nWill you from now on lead a retired life?\\n\\nI was never into any service, so there’s no question of retirement. I have nothing to gain or lose. About what I’ll do in future, only time will tell. See, my idea was never to close this theatre. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have spent a huge amount on changing the transformer and upgrading the sound system. Only this morning, the air-conditioner maintenance person turned up at my door. Till I’m alive, I’ll keep maintaining the building. I am worried about my employees.\\n\\nWhat was the last running film?\\n\\nKesari. A lot of people are writing on social media that Mitra is turning into a mall, but fact is, I haven’t sold the theatre yet. These days, rumours spread very fast. Someone asked me why I was going to a hospital in the morning and said he would fix up an appointment with a cardiac surgeon. I said I don’t have a heart problem. I don’t know why people can’t let others be!\\n\\nFilm frat mourns the closing of iconic theatre\\n\\n‘Single screens are losing out to plexes in Kolkata’\\n\\nDipenda’s character is akin to the one I showed in Cinemawala. I, in fact, used his trophies in the film. I share a long association with him. When my first film, Waarish, released, he had come for its private screening at a south Kolkata theatre. He was so moved that he blessed me for the film. I’ve been to his theatre for many films. Nagarkirtan was running there recently and I visited the theatre after Drishtikone’s release last year. Every time I went there, he would treat me to cutlets. Fact is, single screens are losing out to plexes in Kolkata. They can’t give the wholesome experiences that plexes can now give — there’s no window-shopping involved and it doesn’t give you the false feeling of a Singapore trip. It’s very sad for Bengali cinema and I just hope the theatre reopens soon.\\n— Kaushik Ganguly, filmmaker\\n\\n‘There’s no charity involved in the business of cinema’\\n\\nLast year went well for Mitra. I know that as I visited the theatre after the release of Uma and Ek Je Chhilo Raja. Dipenda treated me to sweets and said those were available only in north Kolkata. About this year, I’m not too sure. He is a khandaani businessman and this news came as a big blow. At a time when a plot of land in Kolkata comes at a premium, it may be commercially more viable to exploit a big property. There’s no charity involved in the business of cinema. I’m only\\nhoping that if a multi-storeyed building comes up in its place, there should be one floor to screen films.\\n— Srijit Mukherji, filmmaker\\n\\n‘This is a huge blow for Bengali cinema’\\n\\nI share an old association with Dipenda. The first time I got involved with distribution was when Rituparno Ghosh made Unishe April. I knew the film could not be accommodated in Mitra and the team was heartbroken. Some of my films like Sudhu Tumi and Cross Connection have run there. I’d often visit the place and tell Dipenda, ‘Get married now.’ It’s such a theatre where Mon Janena can run, much like Cross Connection or Haami. So, it’s a mixed audience. For me, it’d be a reality check every time I went there. Dipenda doesn’t mince words and he’d tell me where a film stood. This is a huge blow for Bengali cinema.\\n\\n— Sudeshna Roy, filmmaker\\n\\n\\n‘I don’t know what is the reason behind this’\\n\\nIt’s a big loss for the film industry. I don’t know what is the reason behind this. As a single theatre, Mitra holds an important place in Kolkata. It also has an audience. I am hoping the authorities will have a dialogue and work towards resolving this deadlock.\\n\\n— Prosenjit Chatterjee, actor',\n",
    " 'In 2006, a beautiful 23-year-old Pragya Prasun was subjected to her worst nightmare. Barely 10 days after she got married, a jilted lover threw acid on her face. Ever since, her life has been about accepting the truth and trying to move ahead. Now, 35-year-old Pragya, who recently won the Nari Shakti Puraskar — the highest civilian award given to women in India — talks to us about her journey from a meek and conflicted acid attack victim to a survivor and a beacon of hope for many.\\n‘My foundation was born out of my greatest sorrow’\\nHer struggle with burns and rehabilitation made Pragya rethink her life goals. “I was lucky to be from an educated and a financially-stable family, who asked the right questions. But while I was undergoing treatment in hospital, I saw a lot of burn victims, who were losing hope, as there was no one to guide them. So, I decided to help them. I started guiding them to the right doctor and giving them information about their diet and the treatments for scars,” she says. In a bid to help burn victims ask the right question and seek help at the right places, Pragya started an NGO, which has rehabilitated more than 200 acid attack victims across the country. From guiding patients to conducting burn camps, where nearly 25 surgeries for burns patients across the country are done in 3-4 days, her foundation (started in 2013) has come a long way. “Other than that, we get surgeries done for the patients one by one or in a group of 2-3 patients throughout the year in Bengaluru, Chennai, Delhi and Mumbai. The surgery count goes up till 3-4 each month. For four years, we have also been getting laser treatment and hair transplant done for 1-2 patients every month,” she adds.\\n\\n‘I tried to push my husband away’\\nWith 47% burns and hypertrophic scars all over, it was anything but easy going for Pragya after the attack. “I was a newly-married woman and barely 12 days into my marital life when I was attacked. To look at myself like that in the mirror impacted me deeply. I thought that my marriage would not sustain, as the first three years were difficult. I felt guilty about messing up my husband’s life and I tried to push him away. But he has been very supportive and has taken good care of me,” says Pragya. “I had suffered two miscarriages and was not in a good mind space, but after my first daughter was born in 2009, my life changed. She was the positivity in my life,” she says.\\n\\n‘It is definitely not easy for my daughter’\\n\\nBut even with a positive family, all has not been rosy for Pragya or her two daughters, as society has been harsh on them. “It used to be extremely difficult to just take my daughters to the playground or drop them at school, as parents would look away from us and even pull their children away. At school, my daughters are asked, ‘Why does your mother look like a ghost?’ But both my daughters are now strong and have developed coping skills,”\\n\\nsays Pragya, who feels that society is yet to become more accepting of acid attack victims.\\n\\n\\n‘Hope Chappak makes people more accepting of acid attack survivors’\\n\\nThis is why Pragya hopes that Deepika Padukone’s film with Meghna Gulzar, titled Chappak, is a changemaker. Chappak is based on an acid attack survivor. “I am glad that Deepika and a seasoned director like Meghna Gulzar have picked the issue of acid attacks as a subject for their film. I was amazed to see the first look. At the same time, I lament that the makeup Deepika wore for the movie is an everyday reality for many like me. I\\n\\nsincerely hope that the way people accept her in the movie is how they accept real-life survivors. I hope that the awareness this creates highlights the menace of acid attack in the society and is, therefore, eradicated from our world forever.”',\n",
    " 'What should have been a regular gig on Saturday night for Bengaluru-based stand-up comic Akshay Laxman at a city hot spot turned out to be quite the nightmare for him. “I was the last act that evening and there were a couple of disgruntled audience members who wanted some of the earlier comics to apologise for a few jokes. When it didn’t happen, one of them flung a beer mug at me,” Akshay recalls, adding that he is set to file a complaint against the offender. “This was a night that came with a prior warning. It was called Undressed Comedy and the guests knew that there would be some sexually explicit jokes. Through the course of the night, there were some jokes that centred on pedophilia,” explains Akshay.\\n\\nAkshay adds. “I guess the jokes got the better of them and since I was the last act, they tried to ask for some kind of an apology, but seeing none coming, the mug was hurled at me in frustration.”\\n\\nThe incident was shared by Akshay on his Facebook page, which was how many other comics heard of it and then condemned the act. Sanjay Manaktala points out, “It is not uncommon for someone to take offence to jokes. But the best feedback in comedy is laughter and these guys could have kept quiet. Inciting violence is definitely not right. And the people who are being accused here are definitely not uneducated. I have seen a similar incident once. I was waiting for my turn for a show in Singapore, where there was another person on stage before me. He was making fun of Australians and their drinking habits, when one of the members took offence and threw a beer bottle. The audience member, luckily for me, was taken out before I went on stage. But at such shows, it is hard to know when someone is offended and how they would react.”\\n\\nDanish Sait, too, adds that this incident is unacceptable. “People need to stop being righteous. When they have gone to a night that has stand-up comedy, they understand that comedy is a heightened state of a regular situation. If one doesn’t agree to the jokes, the best is to get up and leave. Just because one has paid, no one will dance to your tunes. A comic usually prepares a set of jokes that he likes. Hecklers, who are just trolls from the online world in real life, are always around,” he adds.\\n\\nBut how does one learn to handle these hecklers? “It takes a lot of practice. I have seen a lot of senior comics like Sorabh Pant go from ignoring to addressing them to now just asking them to shut up and not ruin the show,” says Danish. Sanjay adds, “Another thing most comics end up doing is building their own network. All of us have friends in the legal sector and other corporate bodies.”',\n",

    " 'After creating music together for almost a decade and tasting success with songs like Saara Zamana (Kaabil) and Hawa Hawa (Total Dhamaal), music duo Gourov-Roshin say that today remixes work because everyone asks for them. We spoke to Gourov Dasgupta, who was in Bengaluru recently, about his love for the city, indie artistes and more. Excerpts:\\nBengaluru’s music scene has changed over the years\\nWhen I used to live in Bengaluru, rock music was at its best. I had come down to the city to watch Iron Maiden perform live. A lot has changed now, though. But that’s the case everywhere. DJs have taken over and people like chill-out music and proper musicians have slowly ventured in to the film industry or are composing for advertisements, because there’s no other way to survive. I have performed at several music\\n\\nfestivals in Bengaluru, and that’s when one could experience the city’s love for music.\\n\\nWorking on remixes is a challenge\\n\\nGourov, who recently tasted success with Total Dhamaal, says that remixing a classic requires a lot of work. “It’s extremely challenging because, no matter how hard you work, a certain section will always criticise you and compare it with the original, whereas some will be happy with it. Honestly, as musicians, we would not want to do recreations. I think that’s a global sentiment. But recreations seem to be working because, every record label and every producer wants them. There is something that seems to be clicking with the audience. Probably, the younger generation hasn’t heard the original version and they are enjoying the rehashed version,” says Gourov, adding that, as composers, they try to add their style to any recreation they work on. “Everyone wants to work on original compositions but, sometimes we don’t have a choice. If a record label says that they want this particular thing, one has to do it or else someone else will do it,” says Gourov. But doesn’t that curtail the freedom of a music composer? “It does.

    " 'Even as he’s busy with his directorials, Karthick Naren has committed to another project. This time around, he will be acting in Caarthick Raju’s Kannaadi, which stars Sundeep Kishan and Anya Singh in the lead. Joining him is Malavika Nair, who wowed the audience with her performance in Cuckoo.\\n\\nConfirming the news, Sundeep, who’s acted in Karthick’s Naragasooran, says, “Karthick and I are good friends, and when we wanted someone young for this role, we thought he’d fit the bill. We’ve been bonding so much now; in fact, I’ve been shopping for his costumes!”\\n\\n\\nHe adds, “Malavika is a great performer, and she is also very choosy about her roles.

    " 'In today’s day and age where body-shaming has become a matter of concern, millennials are taking their fitness seriously. With different exercising techniques and diets, college students are fitter than ever and leave no stone unturned to look and feel their best.\\nHitting the gym and indulging in sporting activities\\nFor many city students, hitting the gym on a daily basis is a must and this is due to various reasons. “I go to the gym daily and spend at least two hours in there. I was into sports when I was in school and once I came to college, I didn’t want to lose touch with my physical activities. So, I began hitting the gym. In addition to this, I run as well,” says Tarun Kumar, a student of Presidency University. Students don’t just hit the gym, but do exercises depending on their strengths and their goals. “I like to lift weights. I was doing functional training, but realised that I couldn’t do a handstand. I was also losing a lot of weight because I wasn’t eating right. That’s when I stopped functional training and started lifting weights and saw the difference,” says Greeshma Ramesh, a student of St. Joseph’s College of Commerce, who hits the gym six days a week. Today, students love to experiment with different exercising techniques. “I indulge in different forms of workouts like power yoga, aerobics, Tabata and more,” says Preksha Vijay, a student of Nitte Meenakshi Institute of Technology.\\n\\n\\nDiet plays a crucial role\\n\\nIf you exercise regularly, but don’t follow a diet, it doesn’t serve the purpose, say students, which is why they too follow a strict diet based on their exercise routine. “Diet is a very important aspect of one’s fitness regime. For example, other than hitting the gym, I follow intermittent fasting with a keto diet. Keto requires you to replace carbs with fat. Intermittent fasting is where one fasts for 16 hours and consumes meals in the eight hour window,” says Preksha.\\n\\nBut following a diet is not easy and cheat days too are done keeping in mind the repercussions. “People say that most of your fitness regime is mostly 30% workout and 70% diet. So yes, diet is important, especially when you’re building muscles. I consume calorie-surplus food and make sure that I consume a particular amount of calories every day,” says Tarun, adding that chicken, eggs and other natural proteins are included in his diet on a daily basis. “Following a diet is hard because calories matter and it’s not easy. Even when I have a cheat day, it has to be calories-based. I cannot go overboard. My diet is specific; I consume brown rice, brown bread and chicken breast, in addition to other things,” says Greeshma.\\n\\n\\nExercising doesn’t come cheap\\n\\nGym subscriptions and following diets are a costly affair and students spend anywhere between `7,000 to `10,000 a month for this. “Along with training fees, protein shakes and supplements, my every month expenditure on my fitness routine is approximately `7,000,” says Preksha. Similarly, Greeshma says that since she follows a strict diet, it does cost her a lot every month. “Since protein powders are expensive, the overall cost of my fitness regime automatically goes up. Since I like having chicken and eggs every day, my per month expenses are anywhere between `5,000 and 7,000,” Greeshma sums up.',\n",
    " 'After creating music together for almost a decade and tasting success with songs like Saara Zamana (Kaabil) and Hawa Hawa (Total Dhamaal), music duo Gourov-Roshin say that today remixes work because everyone asks for them. We spoke to Gourov Dasgupta, who was in Bengaluru recently, about his love for the city, indie artistes and more. Excerpts:\\nBengaluru’s music scene has changed over the years\\nWhen I used to live in Bengaluru, rock music was at its best. I had come down to the city to watch Iron Maiden perform live. A lot has changed now, though. But that’s the case everywhere. DJs have taken over and people like chill-out music and proper musicians have slowly ventured in to the film industry or are composing for advertisements, because there’s no other way to survive. I have performed at several music\\n\\nfestivals in Bengaluru, and that’s when one could experience the city’s love for music.\\n\\nWorking on remixes is a challenge\\n\\nGourov, who recently tasted success with Total Dhamaal, says that remixing a classic requires a lot of work. “It’s extremely challenging because, no matter how hard you work, a certain section will always criticise you and compare it with the original, whereas some will be happy with it. Honestly, as musicians, we would not want to do recreations. I think that’s a global sentiment. But recreations seem to be working because, every record label and every producer wants them. There is something that seems to be clicking with the audience. Probably, the younger generation hasn’t heard the original version and they are enjoying the rehashed version,” says Gourov, adding that, as composers, they try to add their style to any recreation they work on. “Everyone wants to work on original compositions but, sometimes we don’t have a choice. If a record label says that they want this particular thing, one has to do it or else someone else will do it,” says Gourov. But doesn’t that curtail the freedom of a music composer? “It does. But you need to be in a position to decide a lot of things. Thankfully, we are able to strike a balance,” adds Gourov.\\n\\n\\nIndie artists are getting more exposure today\\n\\nUnlike earlier, indie artistes today are performing several gigs, says Gourov. “Things are getting better for indie artistes.

    " 'Actress and kathak dancer Prachee Shah Paandya known for her roles in serials like \\'Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi\\', \\'Iss Pyaar Ko Kya Naam Doon..Ek Baar Phir\\' and more was in Lucknow recently for an event. The actress, who was part of the film \\'Mulk\\' which was shot extensively in Lucknow, says that Lucknow somehow brings out her artistic personality. \"I shot for \\'Mulk\\' which was for around 21 days and starting from having nawabi cuisines on set to chikan shopping, everything was just amazing, I really enjoyed myself. I feel that Lucknow actually brings out the artist in me. Of course, my journey started with Lucknow and Jaipur where I used to come and do stage shows. I feel that somewhere, Lucknow se mera pichhle janm ka naata hai. It has a great vibe and I love wearing chikan suits. I think, given a choice for 365 days I can wear chikan suits and saris. I am not a jeans and a western attire person, so I am happy wearing a chikan kurta and sharara which I think suits me the best. I love the whole feel of the place.\" The kathak danseuse and actress who recently lost her guru Ganesh Hiralal ji, of the seventh generation of the Hiralal family of the Jaipur gharana, feels that she has not just lost her guru but someone who taught her to live through dance. Talking about it and getting emotional at the same time, Prachee says, \"The emotions are coming out in bouts because this morning when I woke up I had no one to talk to. He was 82 and for two years he had congestion in his chest. Who would have thought that one day I would wake up and not find him around me. He was someone who was more of a father figure rather than a guru.\"\\n\\nPrachee with her guru late Ganesh Hiralalji (BCCL/ Aditya Yadav)\\n\\nShe adds, \"I haven’t lost a guru, I have lost my soul! I have learnt kathak for about 25 years and maine hamesha se one-on-one seekha hai. I have not attended any class so that bond was even more special. He was 82-years-old and one would not believe that he had performed on vocal padhanth with me till last year in all major festivals whether in India or abroad. So the thought that he is not around is still difficult for me to take in. My father and my husband were there during the funeral ceremony and they kept on sending me pictures, and I was crying continuously. I still can’t imagine that I have lost him because he is somebody who moulded me as a human being right from the way I project myself, the way I dress up and the way I talk. Unka hamesha se kehna tha ki ‘kaam bolna chahiye’, he never believed in outer appearances.\" Adding, she says, \"The moment you are on stage whether it is for three hours or three minutes, it’s your entry that says it all. These were his words. The only strength I get while I am on stage is the fact that he is there with me on stage who can easily handle my flaws. And despite being a guru, he never overpowered me on stage. He said that ‘this is your stage, you make the laye, you make the rhythm, you conduct the show and I am there to guide you’. I mean which guru does that? I feel that I am thoroughly blessed to have him in his life. It’s been 25 years and all major festivals in the country or abroad, I have travelled everywhere with him and not once did he say ki ‘main thak gaya hoon ya mujhse nahi hoga’. He was the simplest man who was happy having daal, chawal, roti, sabzi and ice cream was his favourite dessert.\"\\n\\nPrachee Shah Paandya (BCCL/ Aditya Yadav)\\n\\n\"Now I really don’t know how will I be on stage, the fact that he will not be present to teach me and guide me is frightening. All these years he has seen me enter into the phase of a wife to a mother and been there when I was expecting my first child. The entire spiritual aspect in me is totally because of him because he was so spiritual,\" adds the actress who has also done films like Judwaa 2 and Student of The Year. The actress shares that the transition from television to film has been more difficult for her. Talking about her role in Mulk, Prachee says the film gave her a strong recognition in the film fraternity. \"I have been a part of television for more than 20 years so to kind of give you a breakthrough in films with a performance oriented role, I think Mulk has kind of started it for me. And now I can hope to do better films. I have done a complete commercial film like \\'Judwaa 2\\' with David Dhawan ji, which sometimes amazes me ki I have done that film. I fall in such an age group where I neither look 45-50 years old nor 25-30. That is a reason I get to play the roles of mother and I believe playing a mother has a more wide range to it and a longer run career wise. So I am happy I got to do a film like Mulk which challenged me as an actor,\" says Prachee, who says she would love to experiment more with such roles.\\n\\n— Prachi Arya',\n",
    " 'It cannot get bigger than this. “I am not going to answer any questions on the plot of Endgame. It took me three years to protect it from Tom Holland and Mark Ruffalo, so I am not going to suddenly give it away,” jokes American filmmaker Joe Russo, of the Russo brothers, co-director of the year’s, perhaps, the decade’s most awaited superhero film — Avengers: Endgame, in a candid chat. This is his fourth Marvel film and the twenty-second film in the entirety of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). In Mumbai, to kick-start the film’s promotions, Joe spoke to Bombay Times on Indian influences in the Marvel series, his comic-book fixation, Stan Lee, Robert Downey Jr (RDJ) being nothing like Tony Stark, need for diversity, longevity of superhero films and more.\\nThis is your first visit to India. Take us through your experience so far.\\nI have never been here before, so I came with an open mind. I am ecstatic. One of the real values of getting to work on these films is that you get to travel across the globe and interact with people from different cultures. I am a big fan of telling my children that their job in life is to collect as many fascinating experiences as they can. Part of that is travelling, cultural experiences, understanding the world and becoming a\\n\\nglobal citizen. It’s really meaningful for me to get my family here.\\n\\n\\nAre you familiar with Indian cinema?\\nI have seen a few Indian films like Dabangg. I think Indian audiences will love the fact that Robot/Enthiran (S Shankar’s 2010 bilingual starring Rajinikanth) was almost a big influence on Avengers: Age of Ultron, 2015 (directed by Joss Whedon). There is a sequence in Robot, where all the robots come together to form a giant snake. In the Avengers movie, there was a bunch of Ultrons, who come together to form a giant Ultron. The scene was eventually cut for time, but that was a direct influence from Robot.\\n\\nYou have made four Marvel films in the past six years. What do you think is integral to the future of superhero films?\\nThe more diverse they get, the more interesting they become. Everyone has a right to see themselves on screen. Audiences become more passionate, when storytellers get more inclusive. The next phase of Marvel movies will get more diverse. Look at the success of Black Panther and Captain Marvel. The new crop of stories will have more pure global influence.\\n\\n\\nDuring an interview Tom Hanks told us that because of the rich technology and CGI, superhero films are living up to the promise of comic books. But eventually, the tide will turn. The stories that always remain with you are the ones showing human condition.\\nThese (superhero films) are human stories! They are highly relatable characters. Listen, I think that if it’s not your cup of tea, you tend to shutout. For a whole global generation of film goers, these movies have become very important. They are a part of their growing up years and pop culture. The best of these movies tell compelling stories about humans, who happen to have powers. The powers are secondary to the experiences of characters as people and the choices that they make. I think the best of these movies have incredible thematics in them. I don’t necessarily think you can call superhero films a fad, when it has this kind of global reach. I think you just have to respect the fact the audience finds a lot in these films to inspire and connect them.\\n\\nSpeaking of #Whateverittakes (the punchline of Endgame), what does it take for you and Anthony (the other Russo brother co-directing the film) to work with so many superstars on one film?\\nIt takes a lot (smiles!). It’s been a great experience for us. We have been very fortunate that this cast is incredible. Look, Oscar winners show up just to do one day’s work for your film, so you are spoilt as a filmmaker with the love of your cast.\\n\\nYou hear things like Robert Downey Jr wanting multiple vanity vans. He even jokes about it. He seems like a diva. Is he like that for real?\\nHe jokes about it (laughs!), but you know why he does that? I think it is to play along and create a persona. He acts like a diva, but he is actually the hardest working actor you will ever work with. He is exceedingly professional. There is a reason why he is one of the biggest movie stars in the world. The energy and effort he puts into his work every second and the way he approaches his character and believes what it is, the way he shows up on set everyday, the level of intensity he brings to his work ethic — it’s commendable. Even when he promotes his films... that requires a lot of effort. He has a certain effervescence about him that’s universally translated and it comes at a cost. It requires him to project himself a certain way.\\n\\nTony Stark feels like RDJ’s alter ego, Chris Hemsworth exudes Thor’s confidence in his physical strength... it’s amazing how these characters seem like they are based on the actors that play them.\\nIt’s interchangeable, isn’t it? You want the actors to have an emotional connect with the characters they play. When you really get to know Robert, you discover that he is nothing like Tony Stark. He has a public persona that he slips into, which is like Tony but when you have an intimate conversation with him, you realise he is very different. He is warm, genuine and generous human being. Chris Evans relates to one of the important people from his childhood. He based Captain America’s performance on this man he knew, so that’s very personal. They all find a certain sense of themselves in these characters after playing them for so long.\\n\\nIs this Chris Evans’ last film as Captain America? He had hinted about it.\\nChris Evans said this is his last film? I don’t know what he has been drinking (smiles). Impossible to say, anything can happen. This is the Marvel Universe. I won’t give away the plot, except that Infinity War was told from the point of view of Thanos and this one is not.\\n\\nIt was heartbreaking to see Loki being killed in Infinity War.\\nA lot of people are upset about that but all good things come to an end.\\n\\nSpeaking of fiercely guarding the plot, is it true that Tom Holland doesn’t get the script because he can’t keep secrets?\\nYes, he doesn’t (smiles). He just gets his lines and that’s it. He is not even told who he is acting opposite of. We use vague terms to describe to him what’s happening. He has a difficult time keeping his mouth shut (laughs).\\n\\n\\n\\nThe legendary Stan Lee is no longer with us. It won’t be the same without him, isn’t it?\\nI wouldn’t be where I am today if it wasn’t for Stan Lee. I grew up on his comic books since I was 10, he is my idol. I believe that his final cameo is in this film. To get an opportunity to not only work on the material that he created, but to be able to work with him was a dream come true.\\n\\nWhat are the pros and cons of co-directing with your brother Anthony, being part of a joint venture?\\nThe pros are the fact that we have been able to make four Marvel movies in the last six years without dropping dead. There are no cons. Of course there are conflicts. We are always arguing and that makes this process successful. We challenge every idea that comes to the table and the best idea wins. It’s about maintaining the right balance between pushing against each other and backing off. Out of that comes a chemistry that creates these movies.\\n\\nThe superheroes abstain from sex. There was an interesting article on this that recently went viral.\\nNo sex in Avengers movies? There was a bedroom scene in Infinity War, which implied that. But I think it is about the demographics. These movies need to translate with the children as well as they do gravitate towards these movies. The whole family should be able to enjoy these films without having to put hands on their children’s eyes. At the core, the characters are human and their psychology has been the focus more than their sexuality I guess.\\n\\nWhat’s next for you in the MCU?\\n\\nEleven years of storytelling, nine franchises and 22 movies culminate into this film. Now, I want to take a little break. We have made four films in six years. You need to find the right stories to be able to reach the audience on this scale. It has been an enriching experience for us.\\n\\n\\nEndgame is the longest Marvel film till date?\\n\\nIt’s 3 hours and 2 minutes. It’s 11 years of narrative culminating into one movie. We are focusing on the original six avengers and closing the book on those characters so a lot of thought went into creating a powerful ending. We just couldn’t get the duration down. It’s a lot of storytelling with lot of characters. No one has ever done even remotely anything like this. A lot of characters in Infinity War are staggering. It requires a lot of disciple and focus to create moments that validate the existence of those characters in that story. Endgame is wrapping up all of this so we knew it will never be under three hours.\\n\\n\\nWhile DC has had an inconsistent run at the box office. Marvel keeps churning blockbusters time and again. What is the secret?\\n\\nMarvel does this amazing job of picking people who care about these films and find immense joy in making them. Be it James Gunn, Ryan Coogler or my brother and myself. I have been collecting comic books since I was 10 years old. Being comic book geeks means you understand the methodology behind the characters. You understand the archetype and values they represent. The audience values the subtleties you bring to the table.',\n",

No one has ever created a rift between us, and to set the record straight, I am not dating Reyhna.”\\n\\nHe added, “I get along with Reyhna and other team members of 'Manmohini', as we are all of the same age group.

In fact, even Reyhna was aghast to hear these stories. The truth is, I have already moved on to the next project and hardly visit the set of 'Manmohini' these days. Just because I mingle well with people, it’s easy to link me with girls my age. A good friendship shouldn’t always be looked upon as an affair.”\\n\\n\\nOn her part, Donal said, “I don’t want to talk about my personal life.

    " \"'Hotel Mumbai', which recreates the Taj siege, met its scheduled worldwide release last week – except in India. No explanation was forthcoming. We try to find one\\nLast Friday, those who were eagerly waiting to watch 'Hotel Mumbai' were surprised to see its shows suddenly go missing, even after the film’s worldwide release date was confirmed as March 29. Directed by Anthony Maras, and starring Anupam Kher, Dev Patel, Armie Hammer and Nazanin Boniadi, the film shows the experiences of the trapped hotel guests and staff as armed terrorists stormed the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel during the Mumbai terror attacks in 2008.\\nThe film’s team is staying mum on why it skipped its originally-scheduled India release, and the silence has led many distributors to speculate that the reason could be its “sensitive content”, while other industry insiders suspect that with the post-Pulwama tensions and upcoming elections, it was bad timing. But turns out, the reason behind the silence is, in fact, a legal deadlock.\\nSeparately, the film was pulled out of theatres in Australia and New Zealand after the mass shooting in Christchurch “out of respect for a country in mourning”, the film’s New Zealand distributor had said. But no official reason has been given for the film missing its India release.\\n\\n\\nWe have no information: Hotel Mumbai’s team Anupam Kher, who plays Head Chef Hemant Oberoi in the film, had tweeted that the film would release “nationwide” on March 29. But he hasn’t tweeted anything about its India release since, and did not reply to our queries.\\nJennifer Nguyen, publicist at Maxine Leonard PR, which is handling the marketing of the film, replied to an email query saying, “We do not have information to share at this time.”\\nHotel Mumbai is a Bleecker Street and ShivHans Pictures film. ShivHans Pictures did not respond to our queries, and Bleecker Street (a New York-based film distribution company) told us they did not have the international rights for the film. Multiple production companies like Electric Pictures, Arclight Films, Thunder Road Pictures and Xeitgeist Entertainment Group are linked with the film. Gaurav Mishra, MD and producer at Xeitgeist Entertainment Group, an Australia and Singapore-based production company, declined to discuss the film’s India release date with a standard “No comments” reply. Electric Pictures and Arclight Films did not respond to our queries.\\nTill last week, BookMyShow displayed the release date of the film as “March 29”, but it was later changed to “December 27, 2019”. Asked if the release was actually deferred to that date, and if they were given any reason for it, a BookMyShow executive declined to comment by pointing out that only the producers of the film could answer queries related to the film’s release. The portal has now dropped the date from the desktop version of its website, which now only says “December”.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe don’t know why the film has not released: Indian exhibitors\\nExhibitors say the last information they had about the film was its scheduled release date. However, the film’s team hasn’t contacted them since. Rajender Singh Jyala, Chief Programming Officer at Inox Leisure Limited, says, “We had information that the film was scheduled to release on March 29, but the distributors or the production house never got in touch with us for the release of the film on the date. So whether the film’s India release has been deferred or cancelled, we have no information.”\\nTinku Singh, SRS Cinemas, adds, “There’s a suspicious silence surrounding the reasons the film has missed its India release date. We never heard about any studio tie-ups with this film or that any Indian distributor has bought the film. But this is not rare. Sometimes, foreign films will tie up with Indian studios or exhibitors for release, but that wasn’t the case this time.”\\n\\nThe film has sensitive content, who will take the risk?: Local distributors\\nThe IMDB page of Hotel Mumbai lists all its distributors from several countries, but there’s no mention of India. Did the film not find any distributor in India? Shaaminder Mallik, a Delhi-based distributor, tells us, “The film was not released on the scheduled date because it couldn’t find any distributors in India. Indian distributors have their own apprehensions about a film which is also giving narrative space to terrorists.”\\nAnother Delhi-based distributor, without wishing to be named, tells us, “We are not sure of the exact reasons the film didn’t release, but our information is that no distributors bought the film because of the sensitive nature of the content. There were reports that the film also attempts to humanise the terrorists. Should the film be released in India in the current scenario? With elections next month, we didn’t want to take the risk of protests and vandalism in theatres. It’s a foreign production, and none of the distributors found it a profitable venture to invest their money and take that risk. In case of opposition to the film, who will bear the losses?”\\n\\nBookMyShow modified 'Hotel Mumbai’s release date from ‘29 March’ to ‘27 Dec’, but its desktop version later changed it to ‘Dec 2019’\\n\\n\\nTussle over who gets to release film lands in Bombay High Court\\nA few days ago, it was reported that Plus Holdings, a Dubai-based company, took Netflix Global, Hotel Mumbai PTY LTD, Arclight Films and Xeitgeist Entertainment Group to the Bombay High Court over who had the rights to release the film in the SAARC region. Plus Holdings claimed that they had the original rights, which they had bought from Xeitgeist Entertainment Group, and moved the Bombay HC to stop Netflix from releasing the film. Netflix has since informed the court that its rights to show Hotel Mumbai on its platform have been terminated by Hotel Mumbai PTY Ltd (HMPL). They then sought to be deleted as a respondent party in the suit which was accepted by the HC. When contacted, Netflix declined to comment, saying that the matter was sub judice. Sources close to Netflix confirmed to DT that they will not be releasing the film in India, and they have nothing to do with the film now. But even though Netflix is no longer associated with the film, Plus Holdings cannot release the film yet, according to the court order.\\nSandeep S Ladda, the lawyer representing Plus Holdings, told us their version of the case. We take you through the case step-by-step.\\nOver the dispute of distribution rights, Ladda filed a petition in the Bombay HC in February to stop Netflix from releasing the film in the SAARC territory. He claimed that Plus Holdings had bought the rights from Xeitgeist. The lawyer alleged that Xeitgeist then unlawfully transferred the movie’s rights to Netflix through a third party last year. However, it was revealed in court that “when the agreement was entered into between Plus Holdings and Xeitgeist, the SAARC distribution rights were held by Xeitgeist, but the agreement was later terminated and the distribution rights reverted to HMPL, the original owner of the film. Later, HMPL entered into an agreement with Netflix, which was also later terminated by HMPL.” Therefore, Xeitgeist contended that it was “powerless to stop HMPL or Netflix”.\\n\\nPlus Holdings’ lawyer appealed to the Bombay HC to stop Netflix from releasing the film, saying that they had exclusive rights to release the film in the Indian subcontinent. Plus Holdings asked the court to restrain Netflix, Xeitgeist, HMPL and other associated parties that it listed in its petition from claiming any rights to the film in India till the time an ongoing dispute between itself and Xeitgeist is being adjudicated upon by a Singapore arbitration court. In a hearing on March 7, the Bombay High Court restrained HMPL from entering into any agreement related to the movie Hotel Mumbai. The matter has now been adjourned till April 4.\\n\\nAs Xeitgeist refused to comment, and Hotel Mumbai’s team didn’t respond to our queries, we are unable to bring you their version.\\n\\n\\nWill the film release in India?\\n\\nThe petition was filed to stop Netflix from releasing Hotel Mumbai. Since Netflix is no longer associated with the film, will it release in India now? Turns out, it is not that simple.\\n\\nThe March 7 order of the Bombay HC states, “In such a situation, whether Xeitgeist at all had any rights to be assigned in favour of HMPL and whether it can be said that Xeitgeist would be legitimately entitled to any rights of exhibitions of the film in question for the SAARC countries would be required to be considered.” Also, the court order states that HMPL, to whom the rights of the film for SAARC were reverted post contract-cancellation, did not appear in the court on March 7, and as stated above, even though HMPL holds all the rights to the film, it has been restrained from “entering into any agreement” regarding the film.\\n\\nSources close to the case say that Plus Holdings will continue to seek to block the release of the movie in India through any other channel as it holds exclusive broadcasting and other rights. Ladda confirmed to us, “My client is ready and willing to exercise their rights to distribute the film in India as well in other countries as per contract.” However, he refused to respond if Plus Holdings is in talks with any Indian exhibitor or distributor for the release of the film.\\n\\nAmid the legal wrangling, it looks like India won’t get to watch a film on one of the most infamous terror attacks on its soil anytime soon, while it puts the spotlight on the attacks internationally.\",\n",
    " \"Actress Sonyaa, who is currently seen on the supernatural show, 'Nazar', has changed her surname. She felt that her original surname — Gupta — brought caste consciousness and hence, decided to drop it. The actress has now started using her late grandfather’s name, Ayodhya, as a tribute to him. Sonyaa says, “I feel that surname gives away not just your caste, but also your standing in the social order. Sometimes, it reflects a person’s economic status as well. I find it absurd. I don’t believe in anything that discriminates humans, be it religion or caste. I strongly feel that surname should not be used as a benchmark to check whether someone is superior or not. That’s why I decided to drop my surname.”\\n\\n\\nSince the last name is mandatory on social networking profiles, Sonyaa randomly entered Pink as her surname. This created a lot of confusion. “I added Pink on an impulse, but it resulted in a lot of confusion with people actually taking it as my surname,” she says, adding, “I never got to meet my grandparents and I don’t know much about them. So, as a tribute to my grandfather, I started using his name as my last name. It makes me feel connected to my roots. Now, I am Sonyaa Ayodhya.”\",\n",
    " 'Whether you’re a professional athlete, a fitness enthusiast, someone who enjoys exercising or wants to start working out to get in shape, the strength of your core is very important. Getting a chiseled core is not easy — it requires dedication and determination. Having said that, remember that every person is different, so what may work for someone else, may not for you, and vice versa. Here are five ab exercises that will help your achieve a strong core.\\nPartial sit up\\nStart by lying on your back and bending your knees. Keeping your arms straight, slowly raise them overhead and start to sit up halfway. Hold on for three seconds and return back to the original position. Repeat this at least 10 times.\\n\\n\\nSwiss ball crunch This may seem easy but is harder than it looks. Take a medium sized Swiss ball and lie back on the ball with your feet on the floor about shoulder-width apart. Make sure that your lower back is well supported. Now, place your hands at the back of your head, start to curl your body while slowly getting off the ball till you’re sitting up. Repeat this eight to 10 times.\\n\\nLeg raises\\n\\nLie down in front of a pole or a heavy piece of furniture. Hold the the pole just above your head and keep your legs straight. Now, lift them up until they’re completely vertical and slowly lower them back. Make sure you don’t touch your legs to the floor but bring them down just inches above it. Repeat this 10 to 12 times.\\n\\n\\nSide/ star plank\\n\\nBored doing the regular planks? Try the side plank, which is twice as challenging. Start by lying down on your right side and place your right forearm on the floor. Slowly raise your hips, keeping your shoulder, hips and ankles in a straight line, pulling your stomach in. Make sure that your right forearm and right foot are bearing your weight. Hold on for as long as you can and repeat on the other side.\\n\\nAnother effective plank exercise is the star plank where you need to get into a push-up position. Next, place your arms and legs are far apart as possible, so that your body looks like a star. Make sure your palms are flat on the floor and your weight is equally distributed. Hold on for 15 to 20 seconds and repeat twice.\\n\\n\\nSwiss Ball Plank Circle\\n\\nTake a Swiss ball and place it on the floor. Place your hands on it as if you’re getting into a push-up with your legs in a straight line behind you. Slowly lower your forearms while they are firmly placed on the ball, keeping yourself straight. Use your elbows and wrists to move the ball in a circular motion, both clockwise and counterclockwise. This exercise requires control so that you don’t lose your balance.',\n",

    " 'What should have been a regular gig on Saturday night for Bengaluru-based stand-up comic Akshay Laxman at a city hot spot turned out to be quite the nightmare for him. “I was the last act that evening and there were a couple of disgruntled audience members who wanted some of the earlier comics to apologise for a few jokes. When it didn’t happen, one of them flung a beer mug at me,” Akshay recalls, adding that he is set to file a complaint against the offender.\\n“This was a night that came with a prior warning. It was called Undressed Comedy and the guests knew that there would be some sexually explicit jokes. Through the course of the night, there were some jokes that centred on pedophilia,” explains Akshay.\\nAkshay adds. “I guess the jokes got the better of them and since I was the last act, they tried to ask for some kind of an apology, but seeing none coming, the mug was hurled at me in frustration.”\\nThe incident was shared by Akshay on his Facebook page, which was how many other comics heard of it and then condemned the act. Sanjay Manaktala points out, “It is not uncommon for someone to take offence to jokes. But the best feedback in comedy is laughter and these guys could have kept quiet. Inciting violence is definitely not right. And the people who are being accused here are definitely not uneducated. I have seen a similar incident once. I was waiting for my turn for a show in Singapore, where there was another person on stage before me. He was making fun of Australians and their drinking habits, when one of the members took offence and threw a beer bottle. The audience member, luckily for me, was taken out before I went on stage. But at such shows, it is hard to know when someone is offended and how they would react.”\\nDanish Sait, too, adds that this incident is unacceptable. “People need to stop being righteous. When they have gone to a night that has stand-up comedy, they understand that comedy is a heightened state of a regular situation. If one doesn’t agree to the jokes, the best is to get up and leave. Just because one has paid, no one will dance to your tunes. A comic usually prepares a set of jokes that he likes. Hecklers, who are just trolls from the online world in real life, are always around,” he adds.\\nBut how does one learn to handle these hecklers? “It takes a lot of practice. I have seen a lot of senior comics like Sorabh Pant go from ignoring to addressing them to now just asking them to shut up and not ruin the show,” says Danish. Sanjay adds, “Another thing most comics end up doing is building their own network. All of us have friends in the legal sector and other corporate bodies.”',\n",

He will join top Silicon Valley venture capital (VC) firm Sequoia Capital’s India unit as managing director. The move is likely to be a booster for the startup ecosystem as Anandan will head an initiative launched by the VC firm to back very early stage startups both in India and Southeast Asia. Additionally, Anandan has been a prolific investor in early stage companies personally and is one of the early evangelists of the local internet market.\\nHe will leave Google by the end of the month and is expected to join Sequoia Capital by the second half of the year, continuing to be based out of Delhi. His move comes after a rejig at Google’s operations in the region where Asia-Pacific head Karim Temsamani stepped down in December and was replaced by Greater China and Korea head Scott Beaumont in March.\\n\\nAnandan’s exit will be a loss to Google as he scaled operations of the company to about $1.3 billion in revenues and was one of the biggest proponents of India’s digital story to the company’s brass.

    " 'By Prabir Jha\\nOne of the ‘make-or-break’ factors for organisations in a hyper-competitive and complex environment is the quality of their executive team — their top leadership. Unfortunately, this always has remained a neglected area. Partly getting the right talent, internally or externally, is a legitimate challenge. But even more importantly, the unwillingness to bite some bullets is another commonly observed pattern. And without this agenda being addressed, a lot of the strategic thinking and doing could fall between the cracks.\\n\\nGet the best and keep the best: The war for the right executive talent is intense. People with the right skills and experience, combined with the appropriate softer skills of leadership, are not easy to find or attract. And yet, how do we ensure we follow the “two-pizza rule” for the size of the executive team and not make it an unwieldy exercise in appeasement? (According to the rule, generally attributed to Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, a team is too big if it cannot be fed with two pizzas). For boards and promoters, this must be an unending priority. The size, the mix, the constant struggle to look for and retain exemplary executive talent is a job not to be delegated or outsourced. Moreover, keeping top quality executives is never easy. They are not likely to be obedient and symbolic court poets. They will have a mind of their own and may even bruise a few egos, questioning some from the past. Whether individual ego will prevail over a larger organisational interest is a tough cookie to bite for many.\\nEnsuring the right dynamics: For chief executives, this must be the toughest challenge to meet after getting the executive talent in. Not everyone is able to forge the right team culture at the top. Creating a shared destiny within the team, encouraging constructive differences, not encouraging dysfunctional behaviours and being ‘true and fair’ with your top team is a CEO’s nightmare. It needs extraordinary wisdom and courage to forge a team of amazingly talented individuals at the top. How many CEOs are rewarded or penalised for something as strategically crucial? Barely any.\\nBEST SELLING PRODUCTS\\nTOP DEALS\\nTV\\nLenovo IdeaPad Slim 3 2021 11th Gen Intel Core i3 15.6 FHD Thin and Light Laptop (8GB/256GB SSD/Windows 10/MS Office/2 Year Warranty/Arctic Grey/1.65Kg), 82H801CUIN\\n41990\\n56690(26% Off)\\nBUY\\nEureka Forbes Aquaguard Aura UV e-boiling, Ultra Filtration, Active Copper, Mineral Guard Technology, Water Purifier (Black and Copper)\\n10498\\n16500(37% Off)\\nBUY\\nPrevious\\nNext\\nPerformance & rewards dilemma: At this level, the stakes for rewards are high. Yet, collaboration to deliver a larger shared organisational goal is not axiomatic. Boards must ensure that overly individualistic rewards do not support integrative execution. There must be disproportionate share of the bonus purse for the executive team resting on shared goals. Or else you run the huge risk of siloed behaviour and independent satrapies, which do not support a sustainable organisation.\\nThe ‘Prima Donna’ effect: Even executive teams espousing a commitment to ‘collective responsibility’ run the risk of dealing with overly high-strung individuals. Much of the “I am special” syndrome typically flows either from a perceived higher importance of their agenda or function, a long tenure in the company, or personal political alignment with the promoter or the board. This is obviously dangerous and must not be encouraged. However, in many situations, the obvious advice is observed more in the breach than in the observance. The inability or the unwillingness to rein in such errant behaviour of such strong men (or women) will lead to some other top talent opting to quit the team. The loss then is only the organisation’s.\\nLack of inspiring role models: Many executive teams may have the requisite bouquet of functional leaders but lack inspiring role models. One of the biggest expectations of a top executive team is to inspire the larger company and beyond, attract and retain talent as also build a strong corporate brand. Not too many leaders at the top can claim to check these boxes off. In addition, a combination of functional experts is not a surrogate for an inspiring an executive team.\\nEach person in an organisation — from the doorman to the chairman — will have a view on whether the executive team of the company is indeed thriving or just unwilling to vacate space. The question is how dispassionately do we firm up our view. Still more crucially, how expeditiously do we make our decisions and interventions. The margin for error is barely there. And the clock is fast ticking away.\\nThe writer is the founder & CEO of Prabir Jha People Advisory',\n",

The schools questioned the reversal of stand, arguing that earlier permission by DoE was “unreasonably withdrawn with retrospective effect” by the April 13, 2018 circular and it showed the Delhi government was delaying implementation of the 7th pay commission’s recommendations in private unaided recognised schools for paying increased salaries and allowances to their teachers and other staff members.',\n",

    " 'NEW DELHI: It is an ambitious plan that seeks to expand Delhi University to six new campuses in Maurice Nagar, Dhaka, Karkardooma, Najafgarh and Bawana, and add three new hostels and a building of the Faculty of Management Studies in South Campus. But describing the construction rates quoted in the Rs 4,700-crore plan as “inflated”, the Union human resource development ministry has junked the expansion and advised the university to seek funding through Higher Education Funding Agency (HEFA).\\n\\nAt a meeting of DU’s finance committee in February, the MHRD nominee, who is also a financial advisor in the ministry, objected to the rates quoted by the university’s Building Committee for the construction. Documents on four projects presented at the meeting, copies of which are with TOI, quoted Rs 70,000 per square metre as the construction cost, with the rate for the extension of Central Institute of Education being Rs 76,327 per sqm.\\nA source present at the meeting reported that the HRD nominee said the correct rate should be in the range of Rs 35,000-45,000 per sqm. “Even in north-east Delhi, where the cost of construction is higher, it is around Rs 45,000 per sqm,” the official said, according to the source.\\nBEST SELLING PRODUCTS\\nTOP DEALS\\nTV\\nEureka Forbes Aquaguard Aura UV e-boiling, Ultra Filtration, Active Copper, Mineral Guard Technology, Water Purifier (Black and Copper)\\n10498\\n16500(37% Off)\\nBUY\\nLenovo IdeaPad Slim 3 2021 11th Gen Intel Core i3 15.6 FHD Thin and Light Laptop (8GB/256GB SSD/Windows 10/MS Office/2 Year Warranty/Arctic Grey/1.65Kg), 82H801CUIN\\n41990\\n56690(26% Off)\\nBUY\\nPrevious\\nNext\\nA senior HRD official later said, “The inflated estimate is not a major issue and can be worked on. However, DU must raise the funds from HEFA, and itself contribute 10% of the costs over 10 years.”\\nFor his part, DU vice-chancellor Yogesh Tyagi confirmed that the estimates were being re-examined. “These are major projects being planned after a long time in the university and will benefit a large number of students,” said Tyagi. The university authorities added that after the estimates are vetted, a fresh proposal would be put before the finance committee before getting the final approval at the Executive Council.\\nIn a letter to DU before the February meeting, MHRD had stated that there would be no new grants-in-aid for infrastructure development. The letter said that all central universities had been instructed to undertake major infrastructure projects through HEFA and not through grants-in-aid from MHRD or the University Grants Commission.\\nThis is the first major development plan in three years, but the finance panel sources said the incumbent administration erred by not consulting CPWD when preparing the project estimates. As another committee member pointed out, “The MHRD nominee cited the figure of Rs 4.2 crore for constructing a reading room and wondered whether the university was planning a reading room or a five-star set-up.”\\nV K Agrawal, member of the finance committee, however, said DU should demand funds for building the new campuses and hostels instead of going via HEFA. He also asked the vice-chancellor to have the construction rates re-examined.',\n",

Initially circumspect, the 16-year-old was flush with excitement four hours later, having created a soft robot claw.\\nThis was the first time in his 12 years of school that the student of Rajkiya Pratibha Vikas Vidyalaya (RPVV), Dwarka, had made something of his own. And for this, he has Ankur Goel to thank for. The alumni of RPVV, Yamuna Vihar, and fellow at Harvard Biodesign Lab, Massachusetts, US, was at the school to conduct a two-day robotics workshop. “After Class XII, I want to study engineering, and participating in the workshop was a great experience. I am very interested in robotics because I think it is the future,” said a happy Shakya.\\n\\nOn Tuesday Shakya and 14 other Class XII and VIII students attended the workshop. On Monday, 15 Class IX students had done so. They used Harvard Biodesign Lab’s Soft Robotics Toolkit to make the electric claw. The initiative was started by Professor Conor Walsh in collaboration with Professor Donal Holland and is funded by Tata Trusts through The Lakshmi Mittal and Family South Asia Institute, Harvard University.\\nGoel, 22, explained, “The goal is to educate students in cutting-edge soft robotics research through hands-on learning.

Vikas Kumar, Shakya’s classmate, would not stop playing with the silicon in the toolkit and exulted, “I am doing all this for the first time.” And Shakya already saw how his creation could be used: “One can attach the soft robotic claw to a drone for lifting light things.”\\nSingh was excited to see the curiosity of his students. “They so quickly understood how to make these things. They will never forget it,” he said. And as a participant of Monday’s workshop ran in to ask him for permission to take the claw to show his friends in his colony, the principal smiled broadly, “This is how education should be imparted, with students getting hands-on learning.”\\nScience teacher Kusum Nagpal is thinking of how to give more students the same experience. “Apart from the silicon, other kit items can be replicated. Maybe we can try with clay,” she said optimistically.',\n",

Pointing out that the police investigated the case for three years, she said: “Court’s time is unnecessarily taken in this prosecution and thus, in this case, public time and machinery cannot be compensated in terms of money. The law and order cannot be substituted for money, hence the legal action (is) to proceed.”\\nVashi said they would consider going to the Supreme Court after studying the HC order.\\nIn 2014, the police cleared her three friends, recommended closure of the case as “false” and sought Sheetal’s prosecution.

    " 'By Prabir Jha\\nOne of the ‘make-or-break’ factors for organisations in a hyper-competitive and complex environment is the quality of their executive team — their top leadership. Unfortunately, this always has remained a neglected area. Partly getting the right talent, internally or externally, is a legitimate challenge. But even more importantly, the unwillingness to bite some bullets is another commonly observed pattern. And without this agenda being addressed, a lot of the strategic thinking and doing could fall between the cracks.\\n\\nGet the best and keep the best: The war for the right executive talent is intense. People with the right skills and experience, combined with the appropriate softer skills of leadership, are not easy to find or attract. And yet, how do we ensure we follow the “two-pizza rule” for the size of the executive team and not make it an unwieldy exercise in appeasement? (According to the rule, generally attributed to Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, a team is too big if it cannot be fed with two pizzas). For boards and promoters, this must be an unending priority. The size, the mix, the constant struggle to look for and retain exemplary executive talent is a job not to be delegated or outsourced. Moreover, keeping top quality executives is never easy. They are not likely to be obedient and symbolic court poets. They will have a mind of their own and may even bruise a few egos, questioning some from the past. Whether individual ego will prevail over a larger organisational interest is a tough cookie to bite for many.\\nEnsuring the right dynamics: For chief executives, this must be the toughest challenge to meet after getting the executive talent in. Not everyone is able to forge the right team culture at the top. Creating a shared destiny within the team, encouraging constructive differences, not encouraging dysfunctional behaviours and being ‘true and fair’ with your top team is a CEO’s nightmare. It needs extraordinary wisdom and courage to forge a team of amazingly talented individuals at the top. How many CEOs are rewarded or penalised for something as strategically crucial? Barely any.\\nBEST SELLING PRODUCTS\\nTOP DEALS\\nTV\\nBosch 8 Kg Fully Automatic Front Load Washing Machine (WAJ2846SIN, Silver)\\n36689\\n51090(29% Off)\\nBUY\\nEureka Forbes Aquaguard Aura UV e-boiling, Ultra Filtration, Active Copper, Mineral Guard Technology, Water Purifier (Black and Copper)\\n10498\\n16500(37% Off)\\nBUY\\nPrevious\\nNext\\nPerformance & rewards dilemma: At this level, the stakes for rewards are high. Yet, collaboration to deliver a larger shared organisational goal is not axiomatic. Boards must ensure that overly individualistic rewards do not support integrative execution. There must be disproportionate share of the bonus purse for the executive team resting on shared goals. Or else you run the huge risk of siloed behaviour and independent satrapies, which do not support a sustainable organisation.\\nThe ‘Prima Donna’ effect: Even executive teams espousing a commitment to ‘collective responsibility’ run the risk of dealing with overly high-strung individuals. Much of the “I am special” syndrome typically flows either from a perceived higher importance of their agenda or function, a long tenure in the company, or personal political alignment with the promoter or the board. This is obviously dangerous and must not be encouraged. However, in many situations, the obvious advice is observed more in the breach than in the observance. The inability or the unwillingness to rein in such errant behaviour of such strong men (or women) will lead to some other top talent opting to quit the team. The loss then is only the organisation’s.\\nLack of inspiring role models: Many executive teams may have the requisite bouquet of functional leaders but lack inspiring role models. One of the biggest expectations of a top executive team is to inspire the larger company and beyond, attract and retain talent as also build a strong corporate brand. Not too many leaders at the top can claim to check these boxes off.

The schools questioned the reversal of stand, arguing that earlier permission by DoE was “unreasonably withdrawn with retrospective effect” by the April 13, 2018 circular and it showed the Delhi government was delaying implementation of the 7th pay commission’s recommendations in private unaided recognised schools for paying increased salaries and allowances to their teachers and other staff members.',\n",

But describing the construction rates quoted in the Rs 4,700-crore plan as “inflated”, the Union human resource development ministry has junked the expansion and advised the university to seek funding through Higher Education Funding Agency (HEFA).\\n\\nAt a meeting of DU’s finance committee in February, the MHRD nominee, who is also a financial advisor in the ministry, objected to the rates quoted by the university’s Building Committee for the construction. Documents on four projects presented at the meeting, copies of which are with TOI, quoted Rs 70,000 per square metre as the construction cost, with the rate for the extension of Central Institute of Education being Rs 76,327 per sqm.\\nA source present at the meeting reported that the HRD nominee said the correct rate should be in the range of Rs 35,000-45,000 per sqm. “Even in north-east Delhi, where the cost of construction is higher, it is around Rs 45,000 per sqm,” the official said, according to the source.\\nBEST SELLING PRODUCTS\\nTOP DEALS\\nTV\\nSamsung 198 L 5 Star Inverter Direct-Cool Single Door Refrigerator (RR21T2H2W9R/HL, Paradise Purple, Base Stand with Drawer)\\n17999\\n22990(22% Off)\\nBUY\\nSamsung Galaxy S20 FE 5G (Cloud Navy, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)\\n39990\\n74999(47% Off)\\nBUY\\nPrevious\\nNext\\nA senior HRD official later said, “The inflated estimate is not a major issue and can be worked on.

The university authorities added that after the estimates are vetted, a fresh proposal would be put before the finance committee before getting the final approval at the Executive Council.\\nIn a letter to DU before the February meeting, MHRD had stated that there would be no new grants-in-aid for infrastructure development. The letter said that all central universities had been instructed to undertake major infrastructure projects through HEFA and not through grants-in-aid from MHRD or the University Grants Commission.\\nThis is the first major development plan in three years, but the finance panel sources said the incumbent administration erred by not consulting CPWD when preparing the project estimates. As another committee member pointed out, “The MHRD nominee cited the figure of Rs 4.2 crore for constructing a reading room and wondered whether the university was planning a reading room or a five-star set-up.”\\nV K Agrawal, member of the finance committee, however, said DU should demand funds for building the new campuses and hostels instead of going via HEFA.

We have also requested the insurance agency to publish public notification blacklisting her.”\\nThe erring pathologist can be tried for these malpractices under the Medical Practitioners Act, 1961.\\nA Supreme Court ruling of December 2017 clearly stated that laboratory reports can be countersigned only by a registered medical practitioner with a postgraduate qualification in pathology. “How can a pathologist be present at laboratories at so many different locations around the same time?” Kulkarni asked.\\nAn MMC official said, “We will scrutinise the complaint letter.”',\n",
    " \"Udupi: The income-tax department has asked the Shiroor Mutt to immediately pay Rs 3.46 crore as tax, creating yet another hurdle in the appointment of a new pontiff at the mutt. Already, a total of Rs 34.34 crore tax settlement is pending at the mutt and tax department had sent a notice to Sode Mutt, its dwanda mutt (twin mutt), asking it to clear it.\\nThis year, the tax department had originally sent a notice for Rs 17 crore to the mutt on its income from various properties. When the mutt approached the I-T department, the latter took a sympathetic view of the condition at the mutt and reduced 80% of the tax amount, asking it to pay only its 20%, which is Rs 3.46 crore.\\nNow, until the I-T dues are cleared, appointment of a new seer is not possible. Even if a new seer is appointed, he will be busy settling these dues, instead of concentrating on mutt' s activities.\\nThe sudden death of Sri Lakshmivara Teertha, head pontiff of Shiroor Mutt due to multi-organ failure, led to Sode Vadiaraja seer taking over the mutt’s administration. Though it was decided then to appoint a new head at the mutt within six months, it did not materialise, prompting disciples to seek an explanation and organise a meeting on Sunday.\\nSri Vishwavalabh Tirtha Swamiji of Sode Mutt said, “Until tax and other financial hurdles are resolved, appointment of a new seer to the mutt is not possible. The new seer, who succeeds Sri Lakshmivara Teertha, should focus on bhakti, knowledge and ‘vairagya’ and cannot work on resolving existing court cases and other hurdles. Moreover, at present, the condition of the mutt is pathetic and looking at the situation, no one is ready to come forward to take the responsibility as successor. Just matching the horoscope is not enough.”\\nEarlier, the Shiroor swamiji and Thonse Jayakrishna Shetty, a businessman, together planned to start a Kanaka Mall at mutt’s property at Kalasanka. For this, they had applied for a loan of Rs 25 crore from Corporation Bank in Manipal. The bank released a loan of Rs 16 crore. However, the construction stopped midway as a dispute arose between the two. Jayakrishna had taken advance from many people promising to give a shop in the mall. However, when the work stopped, the bank issued a notice to both and eventually the property was seized. Hence, Jayakrishna filed a case, which is still being heard in the high court.\\nIn addition to it, Shiroor mutt has been renovated with Rs 25 lakh and more money is required for further renovation before a new seer takes over. Currently, the daily expenses of the mutt is being met with the rent received from other buildings. Shiroor seer had only Rs 10 lakh fixed deposit as asset.\\nMeanwhile, one of the swamis at the mutt said they had chosen a successor for the late pontiff. They, however, do not want to reveal his name. He is studying in the mutt. After training him and looking at his performance, a decision would be taken on appointing him as the pontiff in two to three years, he said.\",\n",

SDM Varun Kumar Awasthi has issued a notice to Digvijaya, asking for his explanation. Sehore collector Ganesh Shankar Mishra pointed out that Sehore is within Bhopal parliamentary constituency. “The model code of conduct is in effect and any candidate or political party giving money, for no apparent reason, is violation of the model code of conduct. The BJP had lodged a complaint,” Mishra said.\\nThe state Congress defended Digvijaya and argued that it’s not a violation of model code of conduct. Speaking to TOI, state Congress media department convener Narendra Saluja said, “This doesn’t qualify to be a violation of model code of conduct. In Indian tradition and culture, any religious person visiting a temple does some charity by helping needy persons. It’s BJP’s degraded mentality that they see model code of conduct violation in a religious tradition. Perhaps, BJP does not believe in helping the poor and needy sitting outside temples.”\\nLunawat retaliated by saying, “Digvijaya Singh’s dirty tricks are not going to work in Bhopal. He is visiting temples by day and dargahs by night. The man who accosted Hindus and RSS for years has suddenly turned pro-Hindu. During democratic elections, political parties have to abide by the law, EC and model code of conduct — all of which are being disregarded by Congress.”',\n",

I avoid giving stronger antibiotics and I don’t write prescriptions,” he said.\\nWhen it comes to diagnoses, Ghatpande relies more on clinic assessment. “I use a stethoscope, check the pulse rate and make use of my palms to sense the patient’s body type. This triad forms the core of my clinical diagnosis,” he said.\\nKashinath Vitekar, 75, a resident of Kasba Peth, is among his many loyal patients.\\n“He never asks for lab reports.

Apart from it, church leaders along with priests have been holding meetings at the church and ward levels to convince its parishioners to come in large number to exercise their franchise on the day of voting.\\n“Though Christians vote, their percentage in voting is less than other communities. Most of our votes are not cast, since thousands of the members of our community reside abroad, and many of those who reside here don’t turn up to vote. As a result, we decided to give youngsters the opportunity to create awareness on voting as a part of the ‘Year of Youth-2019’ initiative.

They have sought an appointment with chief minister Devendra Fadnavis to discuss the possible solutions to this issue and their future prospects.\\n“Only 233 seats are available for 2,054 MBBS doctors from open category who have qualified for PG admissions. Even if we add 37 seats in private medical colleges, only 270 seats are available for general category students. This type of implementation will be the end of meritorious students in Maharashtra,” said Dr Sameer Deshmukh, a resident at GMC.\\nThe seat matrix declared by the CET Cell says 3,913 candidates have qualified for PG admissions in Maharashtra for 1,441 PG seats. Out of these, 2,024 candidates belong to open category. For them, 233 seats are available in all state-run GMCs. These seats can be claimed by reserved candidates as well.\\nCondition in private medical colleges is even worse. As 16% of SEBC cannot be implemented in management and NRI quota of private colleges, the government has added this number to the state quota, which has increased SEBC quota to nearly 30%, eventually leaving only 37 seats for general category students in private medical colleges.\\nDr TP Lahane, Director of Medical Education and Research, Maharashtra state, said general category students should go for seats of management quota in private medical colleges.\\n“It’s a fact that only 37 seats are available for general category students in private colleges. We had no option but to implement the reservation as the high court has directed the same. However, we have deliberately kept the management quota and NRI quota out of any reservation. All 215 seats are available for general category students,” he said.\\nHowever, fees in management and NRI quota is three to five times higher than the state quota seats, so this suggestion has left the protesting students angry.\\nISSUE AT A GLANCE\\nUNTIL NOW: Reservation limited to 52% in Maharashtra\\nNOW: Reservation rises to 78% after including SEBC and EWS quota\\nEWS Reservation: 10 % EWS reservation introduced in Feb 2019 by central government and hastily implemented in Maharashtra within months, despite assurances from the centre about proportionate (25%) increment in seats soon\\nSEBC reservation: 16% SEBC reservation (Maratha reservation) introduced on November 30, 2018, by state government and implemented in this session.

It is the biggest blessing for the party,” he said. “Nalin Kumar Kateel, who was elected twice on a BJP ticket, has turned out to be the biggest failure.

Both Mangaluru Urban Development Authority (Muda) and Mangaluru City Corporation (MCC) are run by administrators. With the deputy commissioner busy with election duty, decisions are being delayed in both these bodies.

If for 10-15 days, properties are not registered, especially apartments built and sold, the problems faced by the industry will only worsen. On property cards, CREDAI will seek an extension from the deputy commissioner, after the polling date of April 18,” said Mehta.\\nExplaining issues on the business front, he said, “Home buyers are adapting to a wait and watch policy and want the formation of a stable government, irrespective of the party. Stability is important for economic growth and development. Enquires for commercial and residential properties have dropped by 75 per cent, indicating that people are politically aware of issues, and economic decisions are now being made based on the political outcome that is expected. This trend was unseen and unheard of, even during the last Lok Sabha or assembly polls,” said Mehta, attributing this trend to the social media.\\nWhile many clients have put investments on hold, Mehta feels it would be ideal for the nation to go for polls in just three phases, and complete the entire process in 15-20 days. “The economy is getting affected. Once bookings reduce, the flow of funds gets affected, thus having an impact on execution,” he said.\\n“Real estate slowdown has been recorded across the country since March, as the government brought down the GST rates, which is being implemented from April 1. People have thus postponed investments on purchase of homes,” he said. “Even at the national level, there is a slowdown visible in the collection of income tax in the month of March 2019 compared to March 2018, and the government is looking at a revenue shortfall of almost Rs 1 lakh core,” Mehta explained.',\n",

Having joined the bank in 1974, Ravindranath told TOI that the bank reached its heydays two years later under the stewardship of then CMD Mulki Sunder Ram Shetty. “It was a golden year in the bank’s history. It excelled in terms of percentage of business and profits,” he said.\\nIt was also the year when the bank opened highest number of branches to spread the vision of its founding fathers: to help the agrarian population in this part of the state.

Ravindranath recalled that Kochi Refineries offered him a job at Qatar on better terms. “It was the love for Vijaya Bank and the trust that Sunder Ram Shetty had reposed in us that saw most of us reject such offers,” he said, adding he would still go around proudly claiming to be a former employee of Vijaya Bank.',\n",
    " 'Pune: After nearly one and a half decades, one of India’s indigenous breeds, the Marwari horses, raced on the tracks of the Pune Race Course earlier this month.\\nThe horses with their unique inward turning ears and wideset eyes once again exhibited that they can hit and own the tracks in their own right.\\nThe efforts of the Indigenous Horse Owners Association (IHOA) have ensured that the Marwari horses, once again, get the opportunity to show their grit.\\nThe races were part of the fourth edition of the Marwari Horse Show organized in the city. The association continues to strive to meet its target of having a platform for these smaller horses to display their calibre.\\nMarwari horse breeder and member of IHOA, Harsh Lunia, said, “We want to see 400 metre, 600 metre and 800 metre races at the Race Courses meant for Marwari horses. We want races built around these horses capability so that the calibre of these indigenous horses can be proved.”\\nPresident of the association, Ajay Nensee said, “Issues pertaining to medical protocol had led to discontinuation of the Marwari horses in the Gymkhana Races. However, there is once again an opportunity for these horses. Racing is at an all-time low due to the introduction of Goods and Services Tax as 40 % of the stables at Royal Western India Turf Club (RWITC) are empty. If one race is organised per weekend for Marwari horses, wherein all medical protocols are followed and with the same trainers that breed thoroughbreds, the breed will get the much needed boost. We are set to initiate dialogue with the RWITC.”\\nAccording to Nensee, thoroughbred horses are bred and trained for speed. “The fastest running stallion and mare are bred for perfect results. However, that is not the case for Marwari horses. In many parts of the country, horses are pride animals and bought only with that intention. We want to change this mindset regarding Marwari horses and are thus promoting their use in sports. These horses are now participating in endurance races. The level of showing of these horses has also been taken to another level with electronic judging for a logical and fair system. When the horse becomes an athlete, the purpose of breeding of the Marwari horses will change,” he explained.\\nIn the first edition of the Marwari Horse Show, there were about 60 to 70 entries. “This year, we had about 135 entries. There is no strong data to prove so but the number of Marwari horses is constantly growing. We have about 100 members now from across Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Gujarat and even the Southern states. The horses have now been accepted by the Equestrian Federation of India and are competing,” Lunia added.\\nLunia said they have not defined a good blood line stock when it comes to Marwari horses. The breed specifications aren’t in place either. In case of thoroughbreds, one can know the blood line and the price. They are an organised industry, he said.\\nMeanwhile, Nensee said, “We do not have enough veterinarian support as there are not many who specialize in equine. In Maharashtra, there are three to four good quality doctors but they are not available on time or for follow-ups. Several vets have showed interest in training camps, but one-day training is insufficient. There is a need for good quality breeding stations and a full-fledged breeding programme.”\\nEquine trainer and horse breaker, Rasika Reddy, said thoroughbreds are a product of breeding between four Arab stallions and English mares. What came from the breeding was a fine breed which was fast. Due to this, people began racing with these horses. One needs to look back to seven generations of the horse to establish that it is a thoroughbred.\\nTo get Marwari horses to race adds another dimension to the breed. While these horses do get to perform in areas of Gujarat and Rajasthan, it is mainly a cultural affair. However, if these horses can demonstrate that they can race, it would be amazing, she added.',\n",

    " 'Pune: It was a chilly morning in February and Mitali Khaladkarr was yearning for tea to soothe her sore throat. “There are not many options near my home in Kasba Peth, and I was too tired to make tea for myself,” she says.\\nOn a whim, she started browsing through her food ordering app when she found what she was looking for --- piping hot tea delivered straight home.\\nHalf expecting how it would turn out to be, Khaladkarr ordered a special chai from Adhya Amrutulya in Raviwar Peth on the food ordering platform. “The delivery was swift and I was happy that l could finally have tea. Moreover, it was the best tea I have had in years,” she recalls.\\nBut little did she know that the tea she had was from one of the oldest tea joints in the city until one of her friends told her so. “I thought it was from one of those fancy tea shops that had come up in the vicinity,” she says.\\nSet up on July 27, 1924, Adhya Amrutulya has moved with the times to reach out to tea lovers in the city. “When we started our business, the population of Pune was around 15,000. Now it is nearly 50 lakh. The city has grown so much that not everybody can come to us, so we decided to reach out to our customers,” says owner Rahul Nartekar, a fourth generation entrepreneur.\\n“In fact, we are one of the first tea joints in the city to deliver tea on food delivery platforms such as Zomato, Food Panda and Swiggy. We typically cater to customers within a range of 3-5 km as the packaging we use keeps the tea warm for around 20 minutes. We receive maximum orders online between Friday and Sunday, mostly from Bhandarkar Road, Prabhat Road, Nal Stop, East Street, Swargate, Shivaji Nagar and Kasba Peth,” he says.\\nBut Nartekar insists that they have only tweaked their business model but haven\\'t really changed with the times. “Our taste has remained the same over the years. The tea is still prepared by hand and is made hundreds of times a day. We don\\'t prepare tea for more than 15 to 20 cups at a time. So, every time you have tea at our shop, it tastes fresh.\"\\nIn fact, they continue to make the same types of tea and coffee which were popular in the 1920s and 1930s. “We make black tea, sada tea, special tea, fakkad chai (boiled in milk) as well as black coffee, sada coffee and special coffee. Our tea used to cost ek anna in 1924, though the minimum price of tea is now Rs15. While special tea costs Rs 25, fakkad costs Rs 30. Our special tea, which is made using different types of masalas, is very popular among our customers,” says Nartekar.\\nThough the shop used to earlier sell various types of sweets such as rasgulla and pedhe, they have been discontinued with. Currently, it sells misal pav, wada pav, adraki poha and upma. “My great grandfather Vishwanath Nartekar introduced the food items after his tea business took off,” says Nartekar.\\nInterestingly, tea wasn’t the first business of Nartekars. “We used to have bhang ka gota here, but after having bhang people generally need tea. So my great grandfather thought of opening a tea shop here so that people can have bhang and tea at the same place. He made up his mind to make tea in such a way that it would be amrutulya, akin to nectar,” he says.\\nThe shop used to be frequented by many freedom fighters. “Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru had tea from our shop,” says Nartekar. In fact, the shop has been popular with singers, film stars and politicians too.\\n“There is a recording studio -- Melody Makers -- diagonally opposite to our shop where singers like Lata Mangeshkar, Mohammed Rafi, Kishore Kumar and Asha Bhosale would record. It was a ritual for them to have tea from our shop before any recording,” notes Nartekar.\\n“Our shop has been a favourite haunt of politicians too like Sharad Pawar, Balasaheb Thackeray, Patangrao Kadam, Suresh Kalmadi, Girish Bapat and others.”\\nAdhya Amrutulya sells more than 3,000 cups of tea every day. “We have maximum customers between 6am and 10 am and between 4pm and 7pm. We serve tea in a special kulhar to keep it warm. Food is served on a plate and bowl made of single wood. We have kept the look and feel as it was in then. For us, it is no longer a business but an effort to keep a tradition alive,” stresses Nartekar.\\nFor the last nice decades, the Nartekars have been sourcing tea dust from Kerala. “We buy a special variety of golden tea dust from there. All the masalas that we use to make tea are also sourced from there. We make several trips to Kerala every year to source the right quality of tea,” he points out.\\nNow, Nartekar wants to come up with packaged tea under the brand name Adhya Amrutulya. “It will hit the market next year. It will be available in tetra packs too. We will come up with different varieties -- black tea, green tea, lemon tea etc. To deliver tea on food delivery platforms, we are working on a different type of packaging to keep the beverage warm for around 30 minutes,” he says.\\nNartekar is hardly bothered about the mushrooming of amrutulyas in the city. “We are not in any competition with anybody. There are two types of tea drinkers – those who drink tea because it is tea time and then there are those who are lovers of tea. We have lovers of tea coming to our shop for generations,” he says.',\n",

His name was dragged in the case solely because he owned the hospital, Jain said.\\nDr Balsubramnyam, who had referred Payal to Shanti Mohan Hospital, had examined her at his clinic on Central Avenue in the afternoon the day she was admitted. “We never treated her for TB as claimed in the petition. She had come with abdominal pain and complained of irregular cycles,” he said.\\nDr Balsubramnyam said Payal had left the hospital on foot after discharge against medical advice. “As per our investigation, she was suffering from anaemia and had water had filled near her heart,” he said.\\nRejecting the doctors arguments, the forum pointed out that as per her death certificate, it is evident that the patient passed away due to cardiac arrest. “But in the papers provided by Shanti Mohan Hospital, there is no mention of cardiac problem. If proper treatment for heart problems was done, her condition may not have worsened,” it said, holding the respondents guilty for her untimely death.',\n",

Ahead of her are the more experienced 31-year-old Humpy (2549 Elo) and 28-year-old Harika Dronavalli (2492 Elo).\\n“I had not expected both to happen so fast. I just hope I can maintain the rating and also go on to become No.1 as soon as possible. This isn’t the limit for me,” Divya told TOI.\\nDivya’s rise in the rating is very fast and she has done “pretty well in the last three months”, according to Humpy. “This is a very good sign for the country.

In three months, she garnered 264 international rating points.\\nFollowing her maiden triumph in the open women category at the AICF International Round Robin tournament, Divya scored her first IM norm too. At the Aeroflot Open 2019, she missed the IM norm but cleared her second WGM norm and also touched a live rating of 2,400.\\nDivya’s consistent performance recently helped her go past senior Indian players like Soumya Swaminathan (2402), Tania Sachdev (2397), Eesha Karavade (2370), Padmini Rout (2364), R Vaishali (2353), Bhakti Kulkarni (2350) and Vijayalakshmi Subbaraman (2342) among others.\\nIn October 2001, a 14-year-old Humpy had cleared the 2,400 mark to become the youngest Indian player ever to do so.

Otherwise, crossing the rating becomes more difficult than clearing norms,” said Divya.\\nWhile Divya broke Humpy’s record of achieving the 2400 Elo mark by some months, the 13-year-old has in her all the ingredients of becoming India’s youngest GM too. Humpy, however, has a word of caution for Divya. “Divya’s tough fight starts from here as her opponents will be more alert. She needs to work a lot to maintain the rating and should only think on how to improve further,” she said.\\n“I think maintaining the rating can be little tough and increasing it will be really difficult now.

I will try to come up to their expectations taking everybody along in the party here. There were all sorts of speculations in the media and amongst people that I won’t get the ticket this time and that usually does happen. But it gave me no sleepless nights. For the last two months, I haven’t been to Delhi. I was confident somehow because of my work here and my connect with the people of the city, the party would repose that confidence in me.\\nHow will you take along rival factions like that of Tewari and Sidhu group?\\nFirstly, I would like to rebut again as I did in the past. There is no rival group in Chandigarh Congress. All true congressmen in the city supported me. As far as Manish Tewari and Dr Navjot Sidhu is concerned, I suppose the final list of Punjab is not out yet. They are trying their best to win seats in Punjab. But I would seek support from all congressmen and Congress leaders from Punjab and Haryana including Manish Tewari and Dr Navjot Sidhu.\\nHow will you woo the voters this time?\\nThe failure of BJP has given the chance to the residents to compare the work done by me and sitting BJP MP in Chandigarh. People can compare work done under the UPA government and BJP government. The BJP government failed both at local and national level. The promises were made to residents but never fulfilled by the BJP.\\nAny message for your likely opponents in BJP.\\nIt’s only after the candidate selected by BJP, I would comment on it. But I would endeavour to set good and high standards of political discourse in the city. That would be my sincere endeavour.\\nWho do you think will be easy candidate in BJP for you to defeat?\\nThis is something which is not within my command and reach. I never gave it a thought. I will decide the next course of action only after BJP decides its candidate. Given the BJP, whether it is A, B, C or anyone, they all belong to BJP. They will all be responsible of acts of omission and commission, and that baggage everybody will have to carry. I think people will prefer Congress this time.\\nYour opponents are planning to raise the Rail Gate scam. How will you tackle opponent's strategy?\\nIf anyone who raises the Rail Gate scam, it will be either out of total ignorance, or out of total malice and mischief which I don’t think my opponents in BJP are. It is defamatory and I have proceeded against some people, I would see what appropriate action I have to take. I have not only got a clean chit but I am cited as prosecution witness in the case.

The firm started as a means to empower women by teaching them how to weave and spin ‘khadi’ cloth and then expanded to give a platform and market to the local artisans.\\n“I had seen that the working conditions and wages for the local weavers, artisans, dyers, spinners was very poor. After completing my graduation, I enrolled in NIFT to study textile designing. I spent two more years researching about the needs and problems of artisans and then developed a B2B model to make and sell fabric to big textile companies. The model is made taking into account the needs of the local artisans, and not for the sake of profit alone,” she said.\\nAbhishek Dubey - Hailing from Gwalior, the co-founder of Muskaan Dreams, which works to improve the infrastructure and digitalize government schools, is working to ensure that children studying in government schools also get the same facilities that private school children get. “I used to notice that government schools did not have proper infrastructure or teachers.

It was only four months ago that Shivakumar had helped his party wrest control of this Lok Sabha segment from the BJP.\\nThe bad blood began last year when Shivakumar entered Belagavi politics by backing Laxmi Hebbalkar in the Belagavi Rural assembly constituency and her camp in the elections to a local co-operative bank. The Jarkiholi brothers from the Valmiki community — Ramesh, Satish, Balachandra, Lakhan and Bhimshi — have long regarded Belagavi as their exclusive political turf. Even though Ramesh and Satish are Congress members, the clan viewed Hebbalkar’s growing profile as a strategy by Shivakumar to gain a foothold in the region.\\nThe coalition politics drama at this stage made matters worse as the Congress refused to offer cabinet berths to Satish and Ramesh, forcing the ouster of the eldest brother, and Shivakumar gained the upper hand in the Belagavi turf war.\\nThe fallout is now visible in Ballari where a candidate with family ties to the Jarkiholis, Y Devendrappa, has entered the fray on a BJP ticket, challenging VS Ugrappa who is backed by Shivakumar. Devendrappa’s son is married to Jarkiholis’ sister.\\nThe Ballari segment is reserved for the Scheduled Tribes. Shivakumar had helped the Congress win this segment in the November 2018 bypolls after 14 years, and he is currently the district in-charge minister for Ballari.\\nShivakumar’s push in Belagavi has strained the Jarkiholi family’s links with the Congress. Ramesh, a sitting Congress MLA, has reportedly moved closer to the BJP, boosting the saffron party’s apparent efforts to topple the Congress-JD(S) government. Balachandra is already a member of the BJP.\\nBefore fielding Devendrappa, the BJP leadership faced a dilemma in Ballari as the Reddy brothers and Valmiki strongman B Sreeramulu stepped aside. The party wanted Sreeramulu or his sister, J Shantha, an MP in 2009, to contest here, but they were not enthusiastic about the move after the BJP lost the bypoll to Congress by over 2 lakh votes. Moreover, Sreeramulu shifted his focus to Chitradurga. The Reddy brothers are staying away from the Lok Sabha campaign to sort out their legal troubles arising from allegations of illegal mining.\\nAll this gave the Jarkiholi family an opportunity to launch a counterattack, through the BJP, in Shivakumar’s new territory, according to some political observers.\\nShivakumar denied there was a proxy war and said relations alone cannot work in elections. “In politics, everyone is related to someone. I too have relations cutting across party lines, but that doesn’t guarantee a win. I don’t want to take anyone’s name or consider it a proxy war,” he said.\\nCongress working president and Bidar candidate B Eshwar Khandre hopes Ramesh won’t hurt the party’s chances in Ballari. “I’m still hoping Ramesh Jarkiholi is a Congressman,” he said.',\n",

This was under the ‘Federalism and Centre-State relations’ section of the manifesto.\\n\\nThe party, however, said that it will give full statehood to Puducherry, a small Union territory on the southern coast which is also a half-state with a legislative assembly similar to Delhi.\\nThe Congress dispensation in Puducherry finds itself stuck in a situation similar to Delhi and has been at loggerheads with the lieutenant governor there, accusing him of not allowing the elected government to function. In Delhi, the AAP government has often expressed its frustration of its proposals and schemes being vetoed by the Centre or put on the back-burner as the national capital lacks the status of the full-fledged state. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has also said that the elected government does not even have the power to hire a peon.\\nWhile the Congress has promised to amend the law of 1991, a constitutional bench of the Supreme Court had in its July 2018 order laid down a similar provision. The AAP government has been sending the files of new proposals and schemes to the LG after implementing them on the ground. The LG, however, continues to enjoy the undiluted power and control over Delhi Police, matters related to public order and land.\\nThough former chief minister Sheila Dikshit has often said that she had enjoyed a cordial relationship with the Centre during her three terms, the manifesto gives enough indication that the Congress government in Delhi too had confrontations with the LG and clarity on the power structure was important for smooth Centre-state relations.\\nThe issue of giving Delhi the status of a full-fledged state has made it to Congress manifestos in the past, but despite appointing committees to examine the proposal, it could not move ahead on it. While Dikshit did not comment on the issue on Tuesday, she had earlier told TOI that during the Congress rule of 15 years in Delhi, she had tried for full statehood but could not achieve it.

More than the public, a leader should know the thoughts and wishes of the public. The leader should not impose (themselves) on the public.”\\nBharadwaj then asked what people in Lamba’s constituency wanted. “The public wants education, health, water, electricity, pollution-free Delhi, corruption-free system, security and respect. With all these they also want their leader to stand with them in moments of happiness and sorrow. They want that their leader does not make a promise which he cannot keep. The public has already been cheated, they do not want more betrayal,” she responded.\\nThe remarks were seen in indirect reference to Lamba’s recent remark that “there is no internal democracy in AAP.”\\nAdding fuel to the fire, Bharadwaj also shared a video in which Lamba was seen slamming Congress and BJP over full statehood. Lamba pointed out that the AAP leadership didn’t consult people before deciding to seek an alliance with Congress. This prompted Bharadwaj to ask when is she going to ask people whether she should join Congress or not.\\nLamba then announced that at 3pm on Wednesday at Jama Masjid she will ask people whether she should join Congress or not. Bharadwaj then told Lamba not to back out and said he will also participate in the meeting.',\n",

It’s in gratitude to Shree Ramnath that Dambab’s palkhi is brought to the temple the night before gulal.\\nThe week-long Shishirotsav at Zambaulim began with the arrival of the traditional nal’l (holy coconut) from the house of late Purushottam Keni in Comba, Margao, to Damodar temple, Zambaulim, in a procession, on Thursday. Dhulpeth is celebrated the day after gulal, which is famous for the sumptuous meals served to devotees. The shigmotsav culminates with the immersion of the nal’l into the river.',\n",
    " 'Trichy: In any game, when the captain is not playing, the vice-captain takes charge. But when the vice-captain fails miserably, fans would wish that the game was better not played. The scenario was no different when the ‘vice-captain’ of Desiya Murpokku Dravida Kazhagam (DMDK) Vijaya Prabakaran tried to don the jersey of his father and DMDK founder Vijayakanth, fondly addressed as Captain, at an election campaign at Trichy on Tuesday. Except for the party flags installed in the venue and blaring songs praising the DMDK founder, there was no similarity between the campaigns of DMDK’s captain and vice-captain.\\nVijayakanth had two innings as a politician, the one before 2016 which was illustrious and established him as an aggressive politician who took on the two Dravidian giants. The other innings he played post-2016 saw him mostly babbling with funny reactions which lent themselves to meme-making material. His son Vijaya Prabakaran, a 28-year-old architect and owner of Badminton sports club, displayed no shades of either of his father’s innings. Vijaya Prabakaran arrived at the venue late by which time DMDK’s Trichy LS candidate was ‘missing’ and his cadres seemed restless. “Had it been Captain, the candidate would have stayed put even if it took hours for him to reach,” a DMDK sympathiser said concealing his disappointment.\\n“We cannot expect him to speak and connect with us like his father. If not for his father, he would have been nowhere near the position he enjoys. Premalatha Vijayakanth articulates well with her extempore speech,” T Parthasarathy, a resident of Palakkarai said while passing time at Eda Street. Out of the 30 minutes halting time of DMDK’s campaign vehicle, his elder son spoke for hardly 8 minutes while the candidate, Dr V Elangovan, and tourism minister Vellamandi N Natarajan accounted for the rest of the time. Forgetting the leaders of his own party, a major portion of the AIADMK minister’s speech was devoted to praising Narendra Modi\\nThe vice-captain’s speech was neither aggressive nor enthusiastic with the listeners engaged in their own individual pursuits. “He looks similar to his father when he was young. His speech will improve over a period of time,” said S Kumar, a DMDK cadre from Gandhi Market. At one point, tourism minister Vellamandi N Natarajan who was standing along with Vijaya Prabakaran signalled the cadres to clap when the vice-captain was unsuccessfully trying to be sarcastic. Suffice it to say that the DMDK vice-captain, who is reckoned as the fourth star speaker of DMDK after his maternal uncle L K Sudheesh, failed to do justice to the importance the party bestows on him and did not emotionally bond with the cadres as Captain does.',\n",

There are a lot of difference between us and AIADMK, especially Jayalalithaa, but it is the chief minister who died.”\\nResponding to fisheries minister D Jayakumar who questioned the intension of the probe, Stalin said he was speaking about the woman who was elected by the people as chief minister and it is his responsibility as an opposition leader to raise question when something wrong happened to the chief minister.\\n“It is deputy chief minister O Panneerselvam who first suspected the death of Jayalalithaa and demanded a probe. It is he who wanted the health minister Vijayabaskar to resign from his post. But, he forgot everything and became silent after he became deputy chief minister,” he added.\\nMeanwhile, Stalin met the parents of the seven-year-old girl who was sexually assaulted and murdered at Pannimadai and consoled them.

    " 'Trichy: It is rare for the performance of local bodies to have a say in a Lok Sabha election, but this time around, there is anger in panchayats situated close to urban local bodies against the manner in which the state’s political apparatus failed to hold elections to local bodies since 2016. Though the elections were deferred citing litigation and administrative reasons, residents say they have been paying a heavy price as their demands for basic amenities have been left unaddressed.\\nThe recent public dissent shown against AIADMK MLA and minister S Valarmathi while campaigning at Sevanthiyanipatti hamlet near Srirangam on March 29 was the outcome of this utter neglect, residents said. Poor focus and delayed solutions for a myriad civic issues including potable water supply and motorable roads have been making life difficult for a section of rural residents. Unlike in the urban local bodies, villagers say the absence of elected councils had robbed panchayats of funds and workforce to get works done. For instance, residents of panchayats situated close to the Trichy corporation limits badly miss their councillors and presidents who used to take their demands to the local body.\\n“Even for a minor grievance like a blockage in drinking water pipeline, panchayat officials take days to rectify. The lapses in ensuring basic amenities are being blamed on the state government which will contribute to the anti-incumbency,” R Kathan, a retired health inspector from Kumbakudi panchayat near Trichy said. While the ruling dispensation would bear the direct impact of this anti-incumbency feeling among villagers, the opposition too may not benefit much as people feel that its representatives had been maintaining silence on the issue of holding civic elections.\\nThe elected representatives in rural local bodies acted as a bridge between residents and the authorities but with MLAs refusing to take up the responsibilities, these people have been left in the lurch. The special officer appointed by the state government has to cover about 20 village panchayats and hence expressed their inability to fulfil their demands. “People are loathing us every time they raise a complaint. They don’t understand our constraints and are upset with our services,” an official source in panchayats department said.',\n",

It is the party of workers and Modi should not worry about our party.”\\nPawar said Modi’s allegation that Congress demeaned Hindus was to be condemned. “Modi’s speech was all about Hindus. He has taken an oath delivered by the President of India that he will work for all sections of society. Are Muslims, Buddhists, Christians not part of India? Have they not sacrificed for India’s freedom? Modi thinks nothing of violating the oath taken on the Constitution. Such a person does not deserve to hold the office of prime minister,” Pawar said, appealing to workers to ensure that the alliance wins both seats, Kolhapur and Hatkanangale.\\nPawar reminded party workers that Raju Shetti, MP of Hatkanangale, quit the alliance with BJP after he found Modi’s policies anti-farmer. Shetti is now with the Maha Aghadi.',\n",
